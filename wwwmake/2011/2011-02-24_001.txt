Subject: Re: slideshow 0.9.9 doesn't seem to support gradients anymore?

So, looks like I have to include that before every slide, then? That's
kinda annoying. I guess I should just write my own CSS for this then?
Something like this seems to work, will it continue to work in the
future?

%css
.slide {
    background: -webkit-gradient(linear, 0% 0%, 0% 100%, from(blue),
to(black));
    background: -moz-linear-gradient(top, blue, black);
}
body { color: white; }
a:link, a:visited { color: white; }
%end

Also, if this is the preferred way to do things, the website could
probably use an update: http://slideshow.rubyforge.org/themes.html
