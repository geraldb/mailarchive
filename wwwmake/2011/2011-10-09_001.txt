I'm a bit stumped. I successfully used S6 to do a couple of
presentations in the past year or two, and am almost 100% certain
haven't touched them since. But neither work now. Example:

<http://bruce.darcus.name/presentations/rendition.html>

So, to be clear, I posted this on the web while back, presented it
without any incident or problem, and then some months later it won't
work.

Any tips on a) what's going on, and b) how to more easily figure this
out myself in the future?

TIA,
Bruce
