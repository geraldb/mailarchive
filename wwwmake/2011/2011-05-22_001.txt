Hello,

  Some more new slideshow projects I've found while reworking the wiki
listing slideshow/presentation projects.

  KeyDown is packaged as a Ruby gem and the blurb reads:

  KeyDown is another 'Presentation System in a single HTML page'
inspired by Showoff, Slidedown, HTML5 Rocks, with a little
Presentation Zen thrown in.


  Shining is also packaged as a Ruby gem and the blurb reads:

 Shining consists of a generator, the command shine, and a basic set
of JavaScripts and CSS. That alone will give you a working system for
creating and showing slides from inside a web browser. From there, you
can use a theme (the default theme is there by, err, default),
customize it, or even modify Shining so it does what you'd like.

Shining also features brain-dead easy deployments to Heroku, so you
can host your presentations as an application for free, provided you
have an account.


  Finally, DZSlides is just a single all-in-one HTML template and the
blurb reads:

  DZSlides is a one-page-template to build your presentation in HTML5
and CSS3. [Note: Uses CSS3 transitions and, thus, requires Firefox
4+.]

   All projects are listed on the new GitHub wiki [1]. If you know any
others you use or can recommend let us know.

 Cheers.
