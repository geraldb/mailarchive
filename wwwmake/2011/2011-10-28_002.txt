Subject: CSSS - Another Slideshow Project with Presenter View, Timeline and

Hello,

  Lea Verou has created CSSS - CSS-based SlideShow System - that
includes a presenter view, timer and much more.

  The intro slide says:

  A simple framework for building presentations with modern web
standards(*)

  - An HTML file contains the whole presentation
  - Themes as CSS files
  - JavaScript handles what CSS can't (keyboard shortcuts etc)

  The drawbacks slide says:

  - Only supports Firefox 3.6+, the latest Chrome/Safari or Opera
10.60+. Why?
    - More lightweight
    - Easier to understand code
    - It's a presentation, so the environment is controlled anyway
  - No mouse click to advance to the next slide. I consider it
annoying.


  Find out more @ https://github.com/LeaVerou/CSSS

  You can find sample decks @ https://github.com/LeaVerou/CSSS/wiki/CSSS-in-the-wild

   Cheers.

PS: I've bundled up the CSSS sources in a Slide Show (S9) pack that
lets you generate CSSS presentations using Markdown or Textile. Note,
I've changed the background-image from rainbow-wood.jpg to a black to
silver linear gradient (e.g. linear-gradient(top left, black 0%,
silver 100%)). Interested? Find the template pack @
