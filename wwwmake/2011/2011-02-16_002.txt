Subject: slideshow 0.9.9 doesn't seem to support gradients anymore?

Hi,

I just updated my slideshow gem (don't know what version I had before,
but probably something about a year old), and now it seems that the
gradient: settings don't do anything anymore -- I just get a solid
white background. Any suggestions?
