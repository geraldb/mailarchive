Hi,

I'm trying to use markdown code similar to this:

<% code do %>
<% control Test %>$Link<% end_control %>
<% end %>

where I want the "<% control Test" line to be rendered as code.

As shown the parser will fail to compile the slides, and I don't seem
to be able to escape it despite trying every combination I can think
of.

Has anyone got a suggestion on how I can get this to work?

Regards,

Jamie Neil
