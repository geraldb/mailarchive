Subject: Writing Comments in the Included .txt files

Hi,

I tried to write comments with '%' in the included .txt files, but it
seems that the included files were processed as pure textile and S9
did not recognize % as comments.

The comments with % seems to work only in the main file S9 directly
processes. Is this expected? Is there any way I can write comments in
the included files?

For example, if I write

    h1. Test title

    % This is a test
    * first bullet

S9 will ignore the line "This is a test" as expected. However, if I
write

    h1. Test title

    {{ include firstbullet.txt }}

and write firstbullet.txt as

   % This is a test
    * first bullet

then "% This is a test" will appear as plain text in the resulting
slides.

Thanks,
YYC
