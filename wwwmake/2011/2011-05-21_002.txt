 and More

Hello,

  I've updated the S6 Blank Templates that lets you create slideshows/
presentations using HTML5/CSS3. What's new?

  To allow easy theming with CSS variables and more the S6 Blank
templates now use the less.js CSS extensions.

  What is less.js?  It's a script that lets you extend "plain old" CSS
with variables, nested selectors, mixins, and more.

  For example, to change the color "theme" of the blank.html[1]
template you now just have to change the CSS variables in the head of
the blank.css.less[2] stylesheet. E.g. change

@color:                  black;

@step-hidden-color:      silver;

@code-background-color:  azure;



@background-gradient-color1: yellow;

@background-gradient-color2: orange;

to

@color:                  white;

@step-hidden-color:      silver;

@code-background-color:  gray;



@background-gradient-color1: green;

@background-gradient-color2: lime;

  Or whatever. You can find out more about less.js online @ http://lesscss.=
org

  Cheers.

PS: Note, the less.js browser script currently won't work if you=92re
using Google Chrome
 and the path to your page starts with "file:///" due to a known
Chrome issue.  (In the developer/js console you will see:
XMLHttpRequest cannot load file:///../s6/shared/projection.css.less.
Cross origin requests are only supported for HTTP.)
