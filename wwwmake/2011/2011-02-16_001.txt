Ahha, figured it out. Apparently I needed to get the s6gradients theme
from github.

Now, an aside on that theme... it is checking specifically for IE to
complain about missing SVG support. It should probably switch to using
Modernizr <http://www.modernizr.com/> to detect whether SVG support is
available or not, since IE9 is going to support SVG. If I remember
I'll try to make a patch and send a pull request...
