Hello,

  I=E2=80=99ve put together the mrhyde-tools gem [1] that includes a comman=
d
line tool that lets you run static site quick starter wizard scripts.
For example, use

  $ mrhyde new starter   # or
  $ mrh n starter

  to download and install (unzip/unpack) a theme archive and configure
a static site ready-to-use e.g.:

>> Welcome, before setting up your site Mr. Hyde will ask you some question=
s.
>>
>> Q: What's your site's title? [Your Site Title]:  Another Beautiful Stati=
c Site
>> Q: What's your name? [Henry Jekyll]: Edward Hyde
>> Q: Select your theme:
>>     1 - Starter
>>     2 - Bootstrap
>>     3 - Minimal
>>   Your choice (1-3)? [1]: 2
>>
>> Thanks! Ready-to-go. Stand back.
>>
>>  Downloading Dr. Jekyll's Bootstrap Theme...
>>  Setting up Dr. Jeykll's Bootstrap Theme..
>>  ...
>>  Updating settings in _config.yml...
>>    title: "Another Beautiful Static Site"
>>    author.name: "Edward Hyde"
>>  ...
>> Done.


  Write your own Mr. Hyde wizard script. It's just Ruby (with an added
mini language) e.g.:

    say "Welcome, before setting up your site Mr. Hyde will ask you
some questions."

    title =3D ask "What's your site's title", "Your Site Title"

    name  =3D ask "What's your name", "Henry Jekyll"

    theme =3D select "Select your theme", ["Starter", "Bootstrap", "Minimal=
"]

    say "Thanks! Ready-to-go. Stand back."

    install_theme theme

    config do |c|
      c.title        =3D title
      c.author.name  =3D name

      c.mrhyde.last_updated =3D Time.now
      c.mrhyde.title        =3D title
      c.mrhyde.name         =3D name
      c.mrhyde.theme        =3D theme
    end

    say "Done."


  For more quick starter wizard scripts see the Mr. Hyde's Scripts [2] libr=
ary.
  For more themes see the Dr. Jekyll's Themes [3] directory. Cheers.
