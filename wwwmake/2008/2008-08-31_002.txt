Excellent, thanks!

The documentation on the website also needs to be improved:

* the Themes section shows various color themes but does not show 
what "gradient: ???" value the user must specify to obtain them.

* there is no list of available values for the "code-theme" 
keyword... and I have no idea what the default value ("amy") means.

In short, an enumeration of possible values for keywords would be 
good documentation to add.

That's fine.  Ultimately, you must decide what contributions to 
accept/reject, and I'm glad that you made such a decision.

Cheers.

True, I noticed that bug (in my patch) later on.

Cheers.
