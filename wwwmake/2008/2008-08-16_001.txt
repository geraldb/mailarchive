Hello,

   I've started a RedCloth mini cookbook collecting how-tos, recipes
and F.A.Qs.  If anyone has any recipes, tips or tricks lets say about
slide shows you're welcome to contribute.

    Full cookbook @ http://rubybook.ca/2008/08/16/redcloth

   Interested in creating PDF's from your textile markup or interested
in rolling your own slide show package using S5? Jason Earl has
published two postings with working code titled:

   'Creating S5 RedCloth Presentations' @
http://jasonearl.com/blog/creating_s5_redcloth_presentations
   'LaTeX/PDF formatting in RedCloth4' @
http://jasonearl.com/blog/latex_pdf_formatting_in_redcloth4

   Cheers.
