Hello Jeff,

   Your HTML snippets only get escaped if you put them inside code
blocks (e.g. @ .. @ or {{{ ... }}} ). I might be mistaken.

  Thanks for highlighting the line feeds issue. I'm actually currently
using a Windows notebook for development (sorry - still having trouble
with getting my wireless card working with Ubuntu ;-) but since I use
the Komodo Edit (text editor) I will change the line ending settings
and commit the update with the next release.  I wasn't aware it's an
issue (other than for the binary startup script).

  Cheers.
