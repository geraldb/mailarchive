I need the same feature. But I would go further and would propose to
use a file which is yielded in the header. Projectwide and for
different slides.

The rails convention seem reasonable. If there is a file slide.head
and no further specifications this file should just be yielded into
the html head. If there is a file slidename.head then only
slidename.slides should be affected.

This is most effective with the least code changes.
