Hello,

> The documentation on the website also needs to be improved:

  Thanks for the suggestions. I know. I try ot get a reference and
how-to plus tips & tricks section added over the next couple of weeks.

> the Themes section shows various color themes but does not show what "gradient: ???" value the user must specify

  Good point. The current built-in themes include:

   diagonal
   top_bottom
   left_right
   repeat
   radial
   radial_off_center
   radial_repeat

  And you can use whatever CSS colors (pre-defined such as red,
maroon, etc or self-defined eg. #0e1f5b #3b5998) you like:

Example Using Facebook-style colors:

gradient: radial  #0e1f5b #3b5998     (use radial gradient theme and
facebook colors)
gradient-colors: #0e1f5b #3b5998     (uses default top_bottom theme)

More examples:

gradient-theme: repeat         (just change theme and use default
colors, that is, marron and black)
gradient-colors: green lime   (use pre-defined CSS colors)

  S9/S6 Tip:  You can open the gradient background theme in your
browser and change the colors and theme (it's just markup) and hit
reload e.g. Try  http://slideshow.rubyforge.org/facebook.svg

> there is no list of available values for the "code-theme"
> keyword... and I have no idea what the default value ("amy") means.
>
> In short, an enumeration of possible values for keywords would be
> good documentation to add.

  The syntax highlighting machinery is documented somewhat in the
syntax slide show @ http://slideshow.rubyforge.org/syntax.html

  Ultraviolet uses Textmate bundles and themes. You can see examples
online @  http://ultraviolet.rubyforge.org/themes.xhtml

  Note, to keep with the CSS property style it's recommended to change
themes from all_hallows_eve to all-hallows-eve (that was the value.tr(
'-', '_' ) you have seen in the code ;-)

  Cheers.
