  Thanks again. I've updated the code and uploaded a new gem (e.g.
6.0.1) to fix the gradient bug. It now works again as advertised.

  I've also changed the footer and subfooter headings/headers to
optional using empty (string) defaults so the -footer not found- and -
subfooter not found- messages will no longer show up in your slide
show if undefined.

  Lastly, if you're wondering why I haven't included your code that
"sanitizes"/normalizes values: Please, note that not all values get
normalized, and, thus, the changing of - to _ cannot get generalized.
It's more an exception than a rule. Lets say you set

title: Merb - All you Need, None You Don't

  than you'd expect your title to be unchanged. Again thanks for your
patch and all the best for your presentation. Cheers.
