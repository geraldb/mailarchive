Hello,

   Jason Garber officialy released the RedCloth 4.0 gem today. What's
new?

 * New SuperRedCloth (RedCloth 4.0) is a total rewrite using Ragel for
the parsing.
 * Markdown support has been removed.
 * Single newlines become <br> tags, just as in traditional RedCloth
and other Textile parsers.
 * HTML special characters are automatically escaped inside code
signatures, like Textile 2. This means you can simply write @<br />@
and the symbols are escaped whereas in RedCloth 3 you had to write
@&lt;br /&gt;@ to make the code fragment readable.
 * HTML embedded in the Textile input does not often need to be
escaped from Textile parsing.
 * The parser will not wrap lines that begin with a space in paragraph
tags.
 * Rudimentary support for LaTeX is built in.
 * RedCloth::VERSION on a line by itself inserts the version number
into the output.
 * Output (less newlines and tabs) is identical to Textile 2 except a
few cases where the RedCloth way was preferable.
 * Over 500 tests prevent regression
 * It's 40 times faster than the previous version.

  More at the new site @ http://redcloth.org

  For the slideshow (S9) gem I've pumped up the RedCloth version to
4.0 and pushed out a new point release, that is, 0.5.2. If you run
into any issues with, let us know. Cheers.
