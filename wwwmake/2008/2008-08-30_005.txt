Subject: PATCH for gradient keywords bug

Hello,

In version 0.6 of slideshow, the gradient keywords do not work.  They
are simply ignored... you always get a Red/Black gradient no matter
what.

Only some keywords, like "title" and "code-line-numbers" worked, but
none of the "gradient*" keywords worked.

I dove into the code and found the problem.  You were trying to call
setter methods in your Opts class with an implicit self receiver (just
like we normally call getter methods with an implicit self receiver).

-    if key.eql? 'code-theme' then^M
-      code_theme = value ^M

However, Ruby doesn't support implicit self receivers for setter
methods.  Instead, Ruby created new *local variables* and assigned
them to the value.

The solution is to make the setter method calls explicit by adding a
"self" before them:

   if key.eql? 'code-theme' then
      self.code_theme = value

I uploaded a patch (diff against SVN trunk) here:
http://snk.rubyforge.org/tmp/slideshow-0.6.diff

In addition to fixing the above problem, I also cleaned up your code a
bit.  There was a lot of redundant / non-idiomatic Ruby code lying
around, IMHO.

I'll submit more patches this weekend if I feel like cleaning up the
code some more.

Cheers.
