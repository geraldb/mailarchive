  With the new S9 update you can now use your own slide show templates
with the load path -i/--include option and you no longer need to edit
the HTML after generation.

  If you want to add a property/header in the .textile file you can
add that too e.g. use whatever header you like e.g.:

  encoding: UTF-8

  And than add in your template:

  <meta http-equiv=3D"Content-Type" content=3D"text/html; charset=3D"<%=3D
@headers['title'] || 'UTF-8'  %>" />

  or similar. That's all there is to it. Let me know if that works for
you. Cheers.
