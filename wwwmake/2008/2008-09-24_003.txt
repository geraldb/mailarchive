Subject: Learning Advanced JavaScript - Interactive Presentation/Slide Show by John Resig - Run JavaScript Code in Your Slides

Hello,

   FYI: John Resig (the developer of the jQuery JavaScript library)
published an interactive presentation/slide show titled "Learning
Advanced JavaScript" that lets you run the code samples in your
slides. It's just JavaScript code after all.

   John Resig writes:

  Recently I gave two talks at the Web 2.0 Expo in New York City and
one for the Boston IxDA.

   An advanced talk on the JavaScript language. Explored functions,
closures, function prototypes, and inheritance. The entire
presentation was given using an interactive site/presentation (tested
in Firefox and Safari).
