Hello Jeff,

  No worries. That's what this mailing list/forum is here for. If the
volume gets to high for anyone you can switch to abridged email
delivery (no more than 1 email per day) or no email delivery or
unsubscribe all together.

  There a quite a few bugs in the "old" RedCloth version. RedCloth is
alive and kicking and a new release, that is, 4.0 is about to get out
of the door any minute (formerly called SuperRedCloth) thanks to Jason
Garber. I'm subscribed to the RedCloth mailing list and here's Jason
Garber's posting from yesterday titled "Ready to release?":

  I think I'm ready to release RedCloth 4.0.  Anyone have any
objections?  Should I tag the latest commit as RC1 or should we just
go for it?  It's pretty much a given that with as many changes as were
made between 3.0.4 and 4.0 we overlooked something and will have to
release 4.0.1 in short order.

I'm sending _why the latest gems to put up on his gem server.  Once
they're up, see if there's anything you want fixed before the release.

Once the new RedCloth release is up I will update the slideshow gem
and that might fix the issues.

   Great ideas. Definitely, the purpose of rewriting the S5 scripts
using jQuery (now called S6) was for making it easier to understand
and extend it for add effects and so on. Any contributions welcome.
You might check out Presentacular that offers effects/animations using
CSS classes

   Cheers.
