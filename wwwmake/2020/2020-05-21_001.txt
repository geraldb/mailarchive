Hello.

I'm using the blank template as the basis for my explorations into css...  
Although I must say, I've found it difficult to improve upon.. some changes 
are imperceptible, others cause unexpected side effects :)

One problem I found was when I tried 16px font size for the feed items, it 
caused some overflow issues... where I can scroll left and right, sometimes 
a lot if a long line didn't wrap properly... 

I saved a copy for example:

https://infominer.xyz/overflow-example/Planet%20Identity%20Reboot.html
https://github.com/infominer33/overflow-example/

I can live with 14px font, I suppose.. it's just a bit perplexing to me.. 
css is crazy.

One thing I've been really curious about, is it possible to make snippets 
view default?


---Thanks for all your awesome work! 

I'm realizing I've been bumping into it quite a lot over the past few years.
