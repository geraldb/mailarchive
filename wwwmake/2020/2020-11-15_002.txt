After some months of experimenting with pluto, fine-tuning templates, and=
=20
adding hundreds of feeds, I've recently launched a weekly newsletter on=20
decententralized \ self-sovereign identity=20
<https://identosphere.substack.com/welcome> tech.

I wrote a blog-post about some of the more technical aspects in developing=
=20
the resources that support the creation of that newsletter, which includes=
=20
some discussion of how I'm using Pluto.

Sharing here, in case anyone is interested.

I suppose, somewhere down the line, I ought to write an article featuring=
=20
Pluto exclusively, describing some of the ins and outs of working with=20
templates, etc. Before I do that, my next task in support of Pluto will be=
=20
to translate some improvements from my personal template into it's parent=
=20
on GitHub. Nothing major, just the little things I've teased out throughout=
=20
the process of thousands of builds, featuring hundreds of blogs.

Until then, here's a link to that blog post:

had begun, and turned inward. I=E2=80=99ve also been busy leveling up, and=
