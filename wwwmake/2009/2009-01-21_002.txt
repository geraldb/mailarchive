  Thanks for your comments and ideas. The plan is to make the
oniguruma dependency optional to make installation easier on Unix/
Linux systems and also to continue with better breaking out the
JavaScript slide show package to make it easier to use different
templates, that, for example, won't depend on or use SVG, and, thus
will run on IE or any other browsers without SVG support. I'm
currently on the road with limited internet access (only once or twice
a week). Sorry for the short and late response. Thanks for your
understanding and patience. I'll be back later this week. Cheers.
