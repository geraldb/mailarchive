Hello,

    I updated the slideshow gem (- that is, version 0.7.4 -) to
include a sample starter template package to demo how to bundle up the
original S5 v11 blank package.

 Update your slideshow gem/installation than issue:

  slideshow -g -t s5blank.txt

 This will generate a sample template package w/ manifest for the S5
v11 blank package in your working folder. If you want to store it
somewhere else add the -o/--output switch e.g.

  slideshow -g -t s5blank.txt -o tpl

Note, the sample package also includes a "starter" slide show called
blank.textile. Delete it once you write your own slide shows.

 To test and use the generated sample package run:

  slideshow -t s5blank.txt blank.textile -o o

 Note, change your output folder using the -o/--output switch
otherwise you may override your templates. Or if you stored the
generated package in tpl folder run:

  slideshow -t tpl/s5blank.txt tpl/blank.textile

That's it. Open up the generated web page, that is, blank.html or
o/blank.html depending on your ouput folder settings and enjoy.


Some more details:

The package is configured to use the following headers in header.html.erb:

author: Your Name Here
company: Your Company Here
title: Your Slide Show Title Here
subtitle: Your Subtitle Here
footer: Your Footer Here
subfooter: Your Subfooter Here


Open up the header.html.erb folder for details. All other included
files get copied verbatim.

 Cheers.
