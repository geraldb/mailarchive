   The S6 packaged with the Slide Show (S9) gem is a rewrite of S5 by
yours truly w/ the intention of making S5-style slideshow code easier
to understand and extend and the built-in S6 package is, thus,
different from some other S6 packages floating around.

  For now the built-in S6 package has no standalone documentation or
site but that will all change starting next week.

  Using the built-in S6 package you're also welcome to add your own
effects using the jQuery library. An autoplay demo with effects is
online @ http://slideshow.rubyforge.org/autoplay.html   More info @
http://groups.google.com/group/webslideshow/msg/a516df26b62adefb

  Cheers.
