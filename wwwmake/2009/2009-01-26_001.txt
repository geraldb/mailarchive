I think, given Suraj's helpful comments, that rdiscount vs. maruku is
a bit of a red herring, and I agree that having a "pure" ruby parser
is better than having external dependencies. (I came to S9 looking for
something that could generate slideshows "on the fly" from my
webserver, and for that task, the fewer external dependencies the
better.)

The trouble I was having was that *slideshow* would choke when fed
markdown with non-link text enclosed in square brackets. I blamed
maruku, but now, given what Suraj says, I think that wasn't the whole
story.

On the command line, maruku has "-b" as a "break on error" option.
With that option set, it, chokes just as slideshow does. But without
that option set, it behaves as Suraj says: it throws an error message
to SDTOUT, but still processes the file appropriately.

When I was replacing maruku with rdiscount on my local copy, I noticed
that slideshow.rb calls maruku with some bits about how to handle
errors. Perhaps those could be tweaked to mimic the command line's
usual behavior, instead of the "break on error" behavior, and the
problem would disappear?
