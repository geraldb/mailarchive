Nice to see S6, as well as its support for SVG. However, if I read the
example document sources correctly, SVG support is required and use of
IE just yields an error message to upgrade to "better" browsers.

While I sympathize with this sentiment, I need to use this for
teaching, where students do use IE. Is there not a way to gracefully-
degrade for non-SVG browsers?

PS - I haven't gotten very far in testing, as doing "gem install
slideshow" failed b/c oniguruma wouldn't compile on my machine for
some reason.
