Subject: getting stepped lists working with markdown

My syntax of choice is markdown extended.

I've been using the excellent pandoc by john macfarlane to produce
slides, but I'd rather use a ruby solution as I've got more experience
with it than Haskell.

pandoc uses
> - item one
> - item two
for producing stepped lists.  see http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html#producing-s5-with-pandoc
I'm wondering if there is a way to get this working in slideshow as
well.  All of the examples seem to be very textile oriented.

If there isn't, any suggestions about how I'd go about extending
slideshow to do this.  put some sort of wrapper on redcloth?

Thanks for any help
