   The built-in templates (for S5, S6, FullerScreen) all use gradient
backgrounds using SVG. You can set the (gradient) colors in your slide
textile source using a header (simple property value pair) e.g:

gradient-colors: #0e1f5b #3b5998      or
gradient-colors: white silver

   See examples here:
   o http://slideshow.rubyforge.org/svn/samples/microformats.textile
   o http://slideshow.rubyforge.org/svn/samples/facebooker.textile

   However, that changes just the background. To change the foreground
color in projection mode you need to open the generated stylesheet
e.g. microformats.css and change:

  html, body { color: white;
             font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-
serif; }

  to

   html, body { color: black;
             font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-
serif; }

  for example. Otherwise you'll end-up with white text on white
background.

   To use the original/unmodified s5 package w/ your own themes you
will have to need to package the original s5 package as a new template
package.

   You can find some info about the new template package format @

   Cheers.
