Thanks. What was tripping me up was those pesky __file__ includes.
So for the benefit of others, to use the "official" s5 theme (or
another theme) AND drop the background:

(1) remove __file__.svg and __file__.css from the manifest,
(2) add the new files to the manifest...
(3) update header.html.erb with the locations of new css files (and
also remove the svg background)

You also answered another question I had (thanks) -- how to declare
the author, company, title, subtitle, etc. variables.

Since I am not a ruby programmer, how do variable declarations work --
can you pretty much just define any variable in the header of your
textile file and then invoke them in the erb file? For example,

    foo: hello world

in the top of the textile file and then use it in the erb file as

   <%=3D @headers['foo']%>

?

Thanks again, btw, I'm really loving this thing. I think I pretty much
found my answer to Impress and PowerPoint.
