  Good question. I'm kind of new to git and GitHub and I'm also kind
of new to jQuery plugins. So I don't have a definite answer or
procedure yet.

   I'd say if it's not too much work you're invited to upload your
source to GitHub either as a fork or as a new package and I will link
back in a new settings, add-ons, tips & tricks page or similar. If you
have any other ideas or suggestions, please feel free to go ahead.

  Cheers.
