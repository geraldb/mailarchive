Hello Bruce,

  The idea is that "step" is easier to understand for newcomers
because it's a simpler (plain English) word (also less to type just
four letters). FullerScreen also uses step. That was the inspiration
(not really my idea).

  If you think there are any issues with S5 compatibility one option
might be to make the stepselector configurable so you can use whatever
you think is best.

  Cheers.
