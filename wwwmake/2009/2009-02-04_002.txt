First off, I love this thing. Textile + Emacs + S5 ... wow!

However, I took a look under the hood and couldn't figure out what's
going on (I can follow php but apparently not ruby :-) )

I'd like to be able to do two things:

(1) How can I use a simple white background?

(2) How can I use the "official" s5 theme? When I generated a "s5-
compatible" presentation and replaced the s5 folder with the
"official" s5 theme, the control panel broke. I'm talking about the
theme you can download from the s5 website.
