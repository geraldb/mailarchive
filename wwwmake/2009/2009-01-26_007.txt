  Thanks for the update and online sample. Looks great. If I can be of
any help with packaging your extension/changes as a template package
w/ manifest using the new format, please let me know.

  Also I will work out in the next couple of days how to best break
out the S6 package so the JavaScript files and templates are easy to
use or extend (without requiring any Ruby scripts or gems). Not sure
yet what's the best way.

   Cheers.
