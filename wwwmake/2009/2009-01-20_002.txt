Hi Gerald! thanks a lot by slideshow: great tool to build slides with
ruby.

I'm maniatic about separate source from build products, but slideshow
writes outputs files where it founds the input file. More: slideshow
only support the input file at current path, i .e. "slideshow ./src/
sample.textile" don't works.

I'm maniatic, so I chnged the slideshow source code. I added support
for full and relative paths in input file name, and I added an extra
option "-o my/output/path". So now I can run

slideshow -o slides1 src/sample.textile

and I get my slides in slides1 directory. By defautlt if no -o is
given, the ouput is writen to directory slides, relative to current,
but you can "-o ." for backward compatibility.

I think this can be useful to more people so, the question is: do you
want merge it?  Maybe  can move to GitHub and fork??. If you dont want
to move now, I can push my version to GitHub, if you want.

best regards
