Hello Bruce,

  Thanks, I pushed (checked in) some changes to allow plugins/modules
and let you change the startup/document ready code so you can
customize the scripts to your needs without requiring changes to the
core script now residing in slides.core.js.

  What's new?

   I split the shared/slides.js script in two scripts:

   o shared/slides.core.js (NEW) - core slide show machinery (without
startup/document ready code - works like a lib)

   o shared/slides.js - sample all-in-one convenience script for
"out-of-the-box" use without plugins or extensions (replace with your
own code and extionsion)


   Now you have two options to add your extensions/changes:

   1)

   o Include shared/slides.core.js instead of previous
shared/slides.js in your web page

   o Move your extractBlockquoteInfo() function to a new script and
include it too

   o Use your own document ready code (that includes
extractBlockquoteInfo() call and drops check for vector graphics
support) and add it to your script or to a new script or to the web
page inline.


   2)

   o Create your own slides.js following the checked in example and
include it in your web page:

your_slides.js

/* add your extensions code inline here */

$.ajaxSetup({async: false});
$.getScript( 'shared/slides.core.js' );

/* or include it here */
$.ajaxSetup({async: true});


$(document).ready(function(){
  /* customize as needed */
 }
});


: I also updated the jQuery library to 1.3.1. That's it. Cheers.
