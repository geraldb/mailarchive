Subject: Slide Show (S9) Gem Updated (v0.7.7) - Added Syntax Highlighting 
	Helpers (using Ultraviolet and Coderay)

Hello,

  I uploaded a new slideshow gem version (that is, v0.7.7). What's new?

  I added a couple of helpers for including and syntax highlighting code.

  1) The new code helper lets you include and syntax highlight code e.g.

   <% code do %>
     your inline code here
   <% end %>

   or include code:

   <%= code 'highlight.rb' %>

   To select the language (default is ruby) use the :lang option e.g.

   <%= code 'effects.css', lang: => 'css' %>

   Note, you can also include parts of files using Codex-style [1]
markers in your source #START:your_marker_here and
#END:your_marker_here and you can also pass along an extra css class
(large,small,tiny,etc.) e.g. this directive in Codex

   :code code/meta/my_ostruct.rb[impl class=code-small]

   becomes in S9:

   <%= code 'code/meta/my_ostruct.rb#impl', class:=>'small' %>


   To select the underlying engine for code highlighting use the
:engine option e.g.

   <%= code 'highlight.rb', :engine => 'coderay' %>

   or use a header to set it once e.g:

   code-engine: uv   # or use your very own code engine here


  2) You can also use the built-in code highlighting engines
"stand-alone" without the code "wrapper" helper e.g.

   To use Ultraviolet use:

   <% uv do %>
    your inline code here
   <% end %>

   To use CodeRay use:

   <% coderay do %>
    your inline code here
   <% end %>

   Note, that uv and coderay only support inline code (if you want to
include code use a nested include e.g.:

   <% coderay :lang => 'css', :line_numbers => 'off' do %>
     <%= include 'effects.css' %>
   <% end %>

   For more options or on how to write your own syntax highlighting
helpers it might be best to check the source of the new helpers online

   That's it. Questions and comments welcome. Cheers.
