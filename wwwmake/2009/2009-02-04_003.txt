S9 is S5 compatible, right? As per the s5 docs, to get an incremental
display (you know, show the bullets one at a time), all you have to do
is set class="incremental". In textile, for example, all you have to
do is:

*(incremental) Bullet 1
* Bullet 2
* Bullet 3

However, this does NOT work when you export to s5. And by "not work,"
I mean the html is generated just fine but everything is shown all at
once.
