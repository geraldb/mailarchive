Thanks for the reply.

Unfortunately, I had already read that thread for using your own
template and couldn't make sense of it. In particular, I don't
understand how the "manifest" file works. This is the manifest file
for s5:

   __file__.svg    gradient.svg.erb
   __file__.html   header.html.erb + footer.html.erb
   __file__.css    style.css.erb
   s5/opera.css
   s5/outline.css
   s5/print.css
   s5/s5-core.css
   s5/slides.js

It seems to include the s5 files opera.css, outline.css, etc.. But
what do the first three lines do? And what are erb files? Sorry, for
the newbie questions -- it's just that I'm not familiar with ruby  :(
