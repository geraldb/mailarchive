   First, thanks for your kind words and thanks for update on the
installation instructions for Oniguruma on Apple OS X Leopard.  If I
can work it out I will try to make the installation optional in the
next couple of days to make sure the slideshow gem is easy to install
to try out.

   About the rdiscount gem:

   As far as I know rdiscount is just a wrapper for the c library the
requires like Oniguruma a separate installation and the discount
library in C only works on Unix-like systems not e.g. on Windows.

   If I can work it out in the next couple of days I will try my best
to add a new switch that lets you choose the Markdown library for the
slideshow package or add a check on startup for installed Markdown
packages so the package that's already installed (e.g. rdiscount) gets
used.

  Cheers.
