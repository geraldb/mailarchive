How hard would it be to mimick something similar to (but better than)
PowerPoint's "notes" mode?

1. The screen is divided into the presentation window and the "notes"
or "handout" window.
2. The presentation is shown as usual in the presentation window.
3. However, at the bottom of the screen, the "handouts" are shown
i.e., whatever is tagged with the "handout" or "notes" class for that
slide.

Here's something akin to an example:

Caveats: Rhe bottom of the screen doesn't actually change. But you get
the idea...
