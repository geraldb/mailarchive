Hi All,

I've been playing around with slideshow and enjoying it. I use
markdown rather than textile, but I immediately ran into problems with
maruku.

I want to use slideshow for academic lectures, and the lectures
involve quotes, and the quotes sometimes involve additions or
omissions in brackets, as in: "Ask not [...] what you can do for your
country." Maruku chokes on the [...], thinking it is a badly defined
link of some sort. Other markdown implementations do not. You can see
the results for yourself in babelmark:

http://babelmark.bobtfish.net/?markdown=Ask+not+%5B...%5D+what+you+can+do+for+your+country.&src=1&dest=2

Happily, it is trivial to modify slideshow.rb, replacing maruku with
the gem rdiscount, which handles these cases just fine. I think it
might have been equally trivial to tell maruku not to "break on
error", but I didn't look into that. It seems to me that one or the
other change ought to be made to slideshow.rb, unless there is some
countervailing reason not to.
