Hello Mohan Gupta,

  I bundled up and uploaded a new sample S5 package with themes
(including blue).
 It's online @ http://github.com/geraldb/sandbox/tree/master/s5themes

  The sample includes all the works e.g. the manifest, header.html.erb, etc.

  You can download it using the -f/--fetch option e.g. issue the command:

$ slideshow -f http://github.com/geraldb/sandbox/raw/master/s5themes/s5themes.txt

  The downloaded templates get stored by default in
~/.slideshow/templates/s5themes


  To use the new templates use the -t/--template MANIFEST option e.g.
issue, for example:

$ slideshow -t s5themes.txt sample -o slides

Note, in your sample.textile source you will need to set the required
theme e.g. (theme: blue # or i18n|pixel|default)

sample.textile:
---------------
theme: blue
author: Your Name Here
company: Your Company Here
title: Your Slide Show Title Here
subtitle: Your Subtitle Here
footer: Your Footer Here
subfooter: Your Subfooter Here


h1. Slide Title Here

* Point One Here

Questions? Comments?


  That's it basically. Let me know if it works or if you have any
further questions or comments. Cheers.
