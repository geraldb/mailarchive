I struggled to get the oniguruma gem to install both on my powerbook
g4 running Leopard, and on my dreamhost account. It was bad enough
that I almost gave up on slideshow. Since I imagine others have run
into the same problem, and since it took a lot of googling and sifting
to figure it out, I thought I'd post the fix here.

The problem has two dimensions. First, the oniguruma gem depends on
the oniguruma library, so you have to install that library. You can do
that on a mac using macports. You can do it on any other *nix by
building from source.

The trouble, it turns out, is that the oniguruma gem can't find the
oniguruma library if it is in a non-standard location. Macports will
put it in a non-standard location. And if you don't have admin
privileges (as on my dreamhost account), you'll have to put it in a
non-standard location, by, e.g.,

% ./configure --prefix=$HOME/mypackages

So you have to modify the oniguruma gem to allow specifying a non-
standard location for the library. I eventually found instructions for
doing just this, and they worked like a charm for me:
