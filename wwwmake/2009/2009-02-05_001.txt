    To start documenting the new packaging format I'd say the easiest
is if I package up the original S5 pack as an sample how it all works
and fits together.  If you're not in a rush I'll post the new sample
package in a couple of days.

   The manifest format basically just lists all files and templates to
copy and generate.

   If the destination is the same as the source as a shortcut you can
drop the source (second para) e.g.:

   s5/slides.js  s5/slides.js   # copy to
<current_working_dir>/s5/slides.js from <template_root>/s5/slides.j

   is the same as:

   s5/slides.js

  Names that include __file__ will run through a template engine, that
is, erb (embedded ruby) and __file__ gets replaced using your
slideshow's name ( __file__.css becomes  microformats.css, for
example).

  All other files get copied verbatim. That's basically the procedure
for now. Cheers.
