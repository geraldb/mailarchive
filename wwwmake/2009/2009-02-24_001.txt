Subject: Slide Show (S9) Gem Updated (v0.7.5) - Supports Plugins/Helpers; New 
	Built-in Helpers Include content_for, include and More

Hello,

  I uploaded a new slideshow gem version (that is, v0.7.5). What's new?

  I added support for plugins and helpers. Now you can use Embedded
Ruby (ERB) in your slide source e.g.

  h1. Today's Date

  <%= Time.now %>


  If you want to use your own helpers put your code in the ./lib
folder (or any subfolders) and your code gets loaded on startup.

  For now the built-in helpers include:

  * include     # Let's you include text. e.g.

  <%= include 'help.txt' %>


  * content_for # Lets you add content to your templates from your
source a la Rails

   In your slide source use:

  <% content_for :head do %>

     your content here e.g. more meta tags; javascript includes etc.

  <% end %>

   In your template use:

   <%= content_for :head %>  and it will include the marked content
from your source. Note, you can use :foo, :bar or whatever key you
want instead of :head and also note a la Rails you can use the same
key as many times as you want. The new content just gets added.


   Finally I added support for (private) multi-line comments using
__SKIP__/__END__. If you want to skip content in your source just
enclose it with

__SKIP__

  not yet ready or private notes/comments

__END__

  As a shortcut if you just use __END__ (without __SKIP__) (Ruby-like)
it will skip everything from __END__ until the end of the file.


  That's it. I will add a couple of more built-in helpers in the next
days and weeks and you're, of course, more than welcome and encouraged
to create your own helpers.

   Cheers.
