Suraj,

Thanks for the tip. I hadn't played around with maruku much, so, while
I guessed some such escaping might keep it from choking, I wasn't
sure. That said, I'm used to markdown processors that handle these
cases gracefully (markdown.pl and pandoc, mostly, but as that
babelmark link showed, *all* the others get it right), and it is
easier for me to change slideshow.rb than change my habits :-)

Bruce,

That blockquote metadata trick is nifty. Now I'll have to go back and
read your earlier post more carefully.
