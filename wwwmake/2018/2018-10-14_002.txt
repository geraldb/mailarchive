I really like the documentation on the project, and after reading through 
it I wandered over to the csv11 organization, and looked through some of 
the other projects.  I found a library called csv11 (which says it is a 
gem, but has no gemspec?).  The short description of the project makes it 
sounds very similar to csvreader.  It looks like you developed both of 
them, and around the same time.  Can you elaborate on the relationship?  Is 
csv11 an early aborted attempt?  Does one underpin the other?
