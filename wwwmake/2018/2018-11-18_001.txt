Thanks for always responding so quickly!

I'm not really talking about any specific errors, I'm more talking about 
continuing through errors once one is encountered. As anyone who has ever 
worked with client generated CSVs will know, this is *always* an issue.

An example would be something like this:

First Name,Middle Name,Last Name
> Johnathan,Madeup,Smith
> Farrokh,"Freddy" Mercury,Bulsara
> Jane,AlsoMadeup,Smith


The improperly quoted line for Freddy Mercury will fail, and we will not 
get to the Jane Smith line. Now imagine there was 2GB of data before that 
line and another 1GB of data after it (a scenario that comes up far more 
frequently than I'd like).

It would be really nice to be able to say, "Hey, line 123456 failed" while 
still importing the rest of the data.

I'm not sure of how possible that is, or if something like that is even 
within the scope of this project, but it would be super cool.

Also, I can't say this enough, your CSV library is one of the best out 
there right now. Thanks for all of the work you've put into it!

Thanks!
- Steve
