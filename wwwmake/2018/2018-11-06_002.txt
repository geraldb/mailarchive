I'm fiddling with some weather data from the University of Waterloo in 
Ontario, Canada.

I just did some very basic testing and found CsvReader 2-3 times slower 
than the builtin gem,
*BUT* the builtin gem couldn't even read the file on Windows!
My tests were executed on a Linux system (Ubuntu 18.4 Bionic) with Ruby 
2.5.3

You can find my test script on PasteBin https://pastebin.com/XvPeuP3M
