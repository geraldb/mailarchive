Hello,

   (Almost) no messages practically for years on the wwwmake group and I am 
under attack now and, thus,
trying to defend myself by backing-up all (google) groups that I 
administrate etc.

   The backup / archive will move to https://github.com/geraldb/mailarchive

   You can follow what I (Gerald Bauer) I am up-to at 
 https://geraldb.github.io/ 
   or at https://github.com/geraldb

    For support questions, please use the https://github.com/geraldb/help 
 repo (upcoming).  

   Questions and comments welcome.
   Prosit 2023!  Cheers.

PS: For the record this wwwmake group has 135 members and 233 posts.
