In this year's google IO, Paul Irish in a presentation on chrome dev tools, 
edited the markdown source and refreshed the browser and the html got 
changed automatically. Now if I understand correctly , in the markdown 
source <https://code.google.com/p/io-2012-slides/>, there is a python 
script that needs to be run to output the html from the markdown. How is 
the markdown file getting read/compiled on the fly when he hits refresh 
after the modifying the .md file.

I am a complete beginner with markdown but I find the idea of using 
markdown for generating slick html5 slides highly efficient. I would really 
appreciate if someone could walk me through how this is achieved.
