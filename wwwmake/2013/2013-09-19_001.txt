Hello,

  I've found some new slideshow projects for Node (in JavaScript):

  1) Cleaver - 30-second Slideshows for Hackers - the site blurb reads:

   Using some spiced up markdown, you can produce good-looking, interactive 
presentations without writing any code or placing a measly textbox.

   All you need to do is write some blocks of markdown, separated by -- on 
its own line and include metadata at the top.
  
  2) HackyNote - Presentations made by Hackers - the site blurb reads:

   A markdown based presentation creator made for developers.

   All that you need to do is access Hackynote, start writing markdown in 
the editor and instantly you will see your presentation being made.

  3) Bedecked - the site blurb reads:

   Bedecked lets you convert markdown files to portable html5 
presentations. Other templating engines can also be supported, right now 
just jade and vanilla html.

   Inspired by hackynote, a simple way to build snazzy presentations from 
markdown files that get exported as standalone HTML. Pop those guys in your 
public dropbox folder (or S3, or whatever) and share.
   

  Found an interesting new slideshow package? Let us know. 

  Cheers.
