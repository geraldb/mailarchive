Subject: Slide show accompanied with audio narration
Message-ID: <alpine.DEB.2.00.1311122259130.24406@web02.tigertech.net>

Is there a way to have an html based slide show accompanied with audio
narration?

I have family history slide show originally in Apple iworks/keynote
that I have been trying to get in a format that I can share. It
consists of 109 images with few words on the slides. I also have audio
of  my cousin presenting the slides. Most of the non image information
/ explanation is in the narration. I've converted it to power point
and then to html using Libre Office Impress (it's presentation
program) to export to html.

I can play the mp3 while stepping thru the slides but it is awkward.
I'm not sure many of my cousins can manage it.  Is there a better way?

I've read just about S5 and S9 and such today and they sound promising.
I'm an Open Source user including Ubuntu.

Fred
