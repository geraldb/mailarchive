Enjoy your digital vacation!

Turns out, my skills at Google suck I guess. I had the `build-essential` 
package loaded already. The results I found the other night led me to the 
assumption, probably because of `require` that the problem was with the 
relative paths.

But, I just found [this 
article](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12731904/rails-installation-failed-on-ubuntu-with-cannot-load-such-file-mkmf) 
which seems to key off of `mkmf`. The problem was that I did not have ruby 
dev installed, so this solved it:

`sudo apt-get install ruby1.9.1-dev`

After that, slideshow installed without a hiccup. Thanks for your help!
