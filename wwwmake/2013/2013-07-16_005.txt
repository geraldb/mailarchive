I'm not a Ruby developer, so talk to me like I'm 2. :-D But I have used S9 
a bit. I'm now on a new VM guest and cannot get it to install. 

It seems to be the relative_require problem with version 1.9.x Ruby, but I 
don't know how to solve it, because all of the help files speak to changing 
your code to import rather than require. I may be able to do that, but 
these are all gems, so I just kind of assumed they would already be changed?


When I attempt to install slideshow, I get:

Building native extensions.  This could take a while...
ERROR:  Error installing RedCloth:
    ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension.

        /usr/bin/ruby1.9.1 extconf.rb
/usr/lib/ruby/1.9.1/rubygems/custom_require.rb:36:in `require': cannot load 
such file -- mkmf (LoadError)
    from /usr/lib/ruby/1.9.1/rubygems/custom_require.rb:36:in `require'
    from extconf.rb:1:in `<main>'


Gem files will remain installed in /var/lib/gems/1.9.1/gems/RedCloth-4.2.9 
for inspection.
Results logged to 
/var/lib/gems/1.9.1/gems/RedCloth-4.2.9/ext/redcloth_scan/gem_make.out


The custom_require seems to be a filter that is supposed to do some 
conversion. But if I'm reading the above correctly, it's RedCloth that's 
passing `extconf.rb` and looking for `mkmf`. So I'm not 100% sure, but the 
best I can tell, it's failing on RedCloth. I use Markdown, and it looks 
like RedCloth is for Textile so I don't mind faking RedCloth if it is the 
problem (and assuming that's possible).


So next, I then tried to install RedCloth; and I also found a lot of text 
on the web saying use versions 4.2.8 or 4.2.3; nothing worked. I always get 
this error, similar to what I see on sildeshow, when installing RedCloth:

ERROR:  Error installing RedCloth:
    ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension.

        /usr/bin/ruby1.9.1 extconf.rb
/usr/lib/ruby/1.9.1/rubygems/custom_require.rb:36:in `require': cannot load 
such file -- mkmf (LoadError)
    from /usr/lib/ruby/1.9.1/rubygems/custom_require.rb:36:in `require'
    from extconf.rb:1:in `<main>'


I see that error with RedCloth when not specifying a version (which targets 
4.2.9) or when trying the supposedly 4.2.3 and 4.2.8 versions; it's similar 
to the error that I'm seeing installing slideshow, so I think it's the 
culprit. But I don't know how to get around it, and I'm not positive it's 
not my ruby setup.

Again I wouldn't be surprised if it's my ruby setup, but any help or 
pointers are greatly appreciated; I can't fully express how much I despise 
PowerPoint and all of the knockoffs that just emulate its horrible behavior.
