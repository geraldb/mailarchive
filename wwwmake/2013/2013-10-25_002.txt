I thought there used to be a way to mark some text to display only in the 
toggled handout mode, but I cannot seem to remember it nor find it.

I'm using Markdown as the input language and the standard s6 themes.

I *thought* that it was either using the `<!--  your comments in here -->` 
or something like `<div name="notes" />` but none of those seem to be 
working, and I'm not coming up with anything when searching this group or 
the web.

Is this only in a specific theme pack? And what is the proper syntax?

Thanks!
