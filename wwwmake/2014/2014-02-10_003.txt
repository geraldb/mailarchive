Hello,

  Sorry, the first post is moderated - unfortunately even this list
gets lots of spam.

  Standard "plain" or "classic" markdown has no support for css style
classes. However, markdown extras such as MultiMarkdown offer, for
example, block attribute list e.g.

* item 1
* item 2
* item 3
{: .step}

  That should work if you use kramdown, for example, for your markdown
conversion. See the syntax page [1], for details. Cheers.
