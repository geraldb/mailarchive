Subject: Keypoint: Web-Based Slide Decks (Packaged up for Mobile App Stores w/ PhoneGap/Cordova)

Hello,

  FYI: I stumbled across Keypoint by Christophe Coenraets - that shows
you how you can bundle up your HTML presentation / slide deck for app
stores.

now. Since I'm doing a lot of PhoneGap/Cordova presentations, it also occur=
red to me some time ago that I could go one step further and package my HTM=
L slide decks as PhoneGap applications. That way, I can demonstrate the Pho=
neGap APIs within my presentation, instead of constantly switching back and=
 forth between my presentation and a demo app: My slides are the demo app.

ainer. It is resource-conscious and fast, with only three slides in the DOM=
 at any given time.
>
> Because it is a Web application, you can also run your presentation in a =
browser on your laptop and navigate with the arrow keys. You'll just not be=
 able to use the PhoneGap specific capabilities.
