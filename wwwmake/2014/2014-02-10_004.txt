Sorry for the possible double post =E2=80=94 didn't see the first one appea=
r.

I'm trying to do step with Markdown and can't get it to work. It looks as=
=20
if the example with incremental bullets is in Textile and when I try=20
*(step) in Markdown, it displays the (step) literally. Am I just messing up=
=20
the syntax in Markdown?
