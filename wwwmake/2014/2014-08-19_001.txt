Hello!  

So I'm working with the *shower template* to try and create a simple image 
slideshow with JPGs, Videos and "Living Images"  

Living images are from a new camera by Lytro (lytro.com) and the only way 
to view and interact with them on the web is to post the image on their 
site and then use an iFrame to embed the image wherever you want. Problem 
is, when I use an iFrame and you interact with the image, you loose the 
ability to change the slide to the next or previous slide.  I have no idea 
how to stop this from happening and still maintain the interactivity with 
the image.  

I put a sample up of what I'm trying to do here: 
http://missingelement.net/shower/

Any help is greatly appreciated!
