Hello,

   To mark individual list item (as seems to be required by deck.js &
friends) add the block attribute list after the marker. Quote from the
kramdown docu [1]:

> A optional IAL [=inline attribute list] for applying attributes to a list item can be used after the list > item marker:
>
> * {:.cls} This item has the class "cls".
>  Here continues the above paragraph.
>
> * This is a normal list item.

  Thus use something like:

 * {: .slide} item 1
 * {: .slide} item 2
 * {: .slide} item 3

or

 * {: .slide} item 1
 * {: .slide} item 2
 * {: .slide} item 3
 {: .step}

  to try to make it work for all themes. Cheers.
