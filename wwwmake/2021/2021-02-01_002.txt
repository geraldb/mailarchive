not sure. I did try putting some variables but pluto tried to read them as 
a site.. I guess that's what you mean by having a 1:1 mapping in the 
schema...

right now I have a copy of the template for each page, was thinking I could 
create variables for common settings, and so use the same template.

mostly I'm just glad to figure out that ordering of youtube videos.

Eventually I may try digging into the pluto code, myself :)
