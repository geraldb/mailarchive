Since I haven't seen any other posts about Bib.TXT here, I'll just link it: 
http://bibtxt.github.io/

I'm working on Bib.TXT support in Citation.js 
<https://larsgw.github.io/citation.js/>, and I was wondering about some of 
the specifications, as the examples are quite short. More specifically:

   - What about the publication type? Should I assume misc, or something 
   else?
   - What whitespace is mandatory, and what isn't?
   - Are trailing and/or leading spaces allowed in values?

That's about it for now.
