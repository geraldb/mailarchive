Check out http://blogs.openstreetmap.org  We went live with an updated 
version of pluto powering that site.

Read a bit more about that here: 
https://blog.gravitystorm.co.uk/2017/01/31/upgrading-the-osm-blogs-aggregator/ 
 Some work by Andy Allen picking up on prior work by Shaun McDonald. I've 
been looking at the css.

Hopefully this is the mailing list to talk about "pluto". The website and 
git organisation all have the name "feedreader" and many of the git repos 
give the URL: http://groups.google.com/group/feedreader which is broken. 
Meanwhile this group is called "wwwmake". so that's confusing.
