I was thinking of delving into some development of pluto. I can probably 
help if I get set up, but I have some questions which are probably a bit 
noddy.

I see there's a lot of use of "hoe", so when I tried running "rake test" 
for example, it complained I didn't have that installed. Should there be a 
Gemfile referencing it? And there are no .gemspec files. How would I build 
/ rebuild the pluto gems? And do I need to do that as a step in seeing the 
results of code changes on a pluto site? or what's a sensible development 
workflow to do that?
