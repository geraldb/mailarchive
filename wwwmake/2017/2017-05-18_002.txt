Thanks for the fast reply! I'll see if I can work on this this weekend. 
Here's <https://github.com/larsgw/citation.js/issues/47> the feature 
request, I might post progress on there. On the leading/trailing spaces: I 
meant to ask if values *can* have leading/trailing spaces, as there are no 
string delimiters that I know of.

PS: I read the page again, and it says that quotes and commas aren't 
required, but *can* they be used?

<br>First the two &quot;easy&quot; answers:

<br>=C2=A0 =C2=A0Whitespace are all optional except for newline to &quot;br=
