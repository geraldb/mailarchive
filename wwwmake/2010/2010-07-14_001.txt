Hello David,

  Good idea. I put it on my list to add once I get to work on the
JavaScript-side a little.

  If you use an alternative Markdown engine/converter such as the
default in slideshow, that is, kramdown - you can use a Markdown
extension like this:

* point one
* point two
{:.step}

  See http://kramdown.rubyforge.org/quickref.html#block-attributes for
details.

 As an alternative you might try add your own little filter. Just add
the filter code inside your own Pandoc converter.

  Good news. That already works today. Just change your
slides.html.erb template. Lets say you use these headers in your
source:

Title: Your Title Here
Subtitle: Your Subtitle Here
Author: Your Name Here
Company: Your Company Here

  Than just add a title slide to your template before <%= @content %>.
Sample:

<div class="slide titlepage">
<h1><%= @headers['title'] %></h1>
<h2><%= @headers['subtitle'] %></h2>
<h3><%= @headers['author']%></h3>
<h4><%= @headers['company']%></h4>
</div>

  See a sample here @ http://github.com/geraldb/slideshow-s5-blank/blob/master/slides.html.erb

   Again thanks for your comments. Cheers. Gerald
