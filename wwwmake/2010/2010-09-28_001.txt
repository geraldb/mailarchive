Thank your for s6.

In chromium the jumplist although full and with the proper CSS
properties doesn't get rendered at all. I get a select list with blank
entries. I'm using Chromium  6.0.472.62.

In opera the list appears as it should, but the mouse selection
doesn't work. Keyboard selection works: up and down. I'm using Opera
10.62.6438.

In firefox 3.6.7 it works perfectly.

Thank you,
Ant=F3nio
