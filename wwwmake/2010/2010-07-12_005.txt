Subject: support for pandoc-ruby

I've been playing around with adding support for the pandoc-ruby
markdown converter (really just a ruby wrapper around pandoc). I have
something that works up at

http://github.com/dsanson/slideshow

pandoc-ruby can generate s5-formatted html directly. So I modified
gen.rb to disable post-processing on html generated by pandoc-ruby.

Pandoc's extended markdown uses percentage signs to indicate a
metadata block (title, author, date) at the beginning of a file. The
"comments-percent_style" filter removed this metadata. To avoid this,
I modified gen.rb to disable text filters when using pandoc-ruby (yes,
this is overkill, but I couldn't figure out how to selectively disable
only this filter).

Pandoc's s5 output uses the "incremental" class name rather than
"step". But a quick gsub fixed that problem.
