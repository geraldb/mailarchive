Hello,

  I uploaded a new slideshow gem version (that is, v0.9). What's new?

  * Added support for !SLIDE (and alternative syntax %slide)
  * Added support for comments using %, %begin/%end and %end
  * Added more helpers (step, google_analytics, left/right for two-
column layouts)
  * Added support for Django-style expressions and statements as an
alternative to <% %>
  * Added support for configuring text filters in slideshow.yml
  * Added support for configuring Markdown engines in slideshow.yml
  * Added fetch shortcuts (configure in slideshow.yml)
  * Added support for template manifests w/o .txt extensions
  * Removed old options -s5,=97fullerscreen (use -t s5blank or -t
fullerscreen instead)

  I've tested the new features with a new sample slideshow, that is,
Jim Weirich's "10 Things Every Java Programmer Should Know About Ruby"
talk.

  You can find the slides @ http://slideshow.rubyforge.org/10things.html
  And the PDF version @ http://slideshow.rubyforge.org/10things.pdf.html
  And the generated PDF @ http://slideshow.rubyforge.org/10things.pdf

 The source is online @ http://github.com/geraldb/slideshow/blob/master/sam=
ples/10things.text

 Allow me to highlight some features:

  ** Use !SLIDE for slides with no title. Example:

   !SLIDE

      $ ri Array
      ----------------------------------------------------------
Module: Array
            Arrays are ordered, integer-indexed collections of any
object.



   ** Use % for comments anywhere (including headers) and %begin/%end
for multi-line comments. Example:

    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    % Start off with some headers

    title: 10 Things Every Java Programmer Should Know About Ruby
    author: Jim Weirich

    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    % Let's go. The presentation starts here

    # 10 Things Every Java Programmer Should Know About Ruby

    Jim Weirich
    {: .center}


   ** New helpers such as Google Analytics tracker. Just add:

    {{ google_analytics :code =3D> 'UA-YOUR-CODE-HERE' }}


   ** left/right helpers for two-column layout. Example:

    {% left %}

    ### Java is

    * Strongly,
    * Statically,
    * Manifestly

    typed.
    {% end %}

    {% right %}

    ### Ruby is

    * Strongly,
    * Dynamically,
    * Implicitly

    typed.
    {% end %}


 ** Fetch template packs with shortcuts (configured in slideshow.yml)
Example:

  Instead of

    slideshow -f http://github.com/geraldb/slideshow-s6-blank/raw/master/s6=
blank.txt

  Just use

    slideshow -f s6blank


 ** Use template manifests without .txt extensions

   Another shortcut. If you use your own templates you can now pass
along the manifest without .txt extension.

   Instead of

     slideshow -t s6blank.txt tutorial.textile

   Just use

     slideshow -t s6blank tutorial.textile


 That's it. Questions and comments welcome. Cheers. Gerald
