I'm sorry. It is late and I was being absent minded.

This template really *only* works in combination with my patched
version of slideshow, using pandoc-ruby. This is because the
slides.html.erb file doesn't contain <div class="layout"> bits that
pandoc happily supplies.

And, on the flip side, my patched version of slideshow only really
works with this template: with other templates you will get duplicate
layout divs.

Both are fairly easy to fix. Probably the right thing to do is modify
markdown.rb to chop off the layout div that pandoc-ruby produces, so
that the patched version works with all templates, and then add those
bits back into the template...
