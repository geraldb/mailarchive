Hello,

  Thanks for your support for the pandoc-ruby converter. I merged your
changes into the trunk and added the following changes:

  * Run all filters as usual (just exclude directives_percent_style
and comments-percent-style for pandoc)
  * Run post processing as usual (just break slides using div h1
instead of plain h1)
  * Changed PandocRuby to convert from :markdown to :html (no need for
PandocRuby to break slides for S5; gets handled by S9 ;-) and works
not just for S5 but for S6, Slidy, and others too)

  I also pushed a new gem to RubyGems, that is, v0.9.3.   Just update
and let me know if it works for you. My small tests on a Linux machine
were all working including your s6clean template pack.

   Thanks again for your efforts and for highlighting the pandoc-ruby
library.  Cheers.
