Hi all,

I started to adapt the code to ruby 1.9. It works but didn't check the
entore code and options at the moment.
For whom want to try, a first preview is here http://github.com/vacmf/slideshow/downloads
I tried to contact the author to push changes but didn't get any
answer yet.

Lorenzo
