Subject: installing templates from github using -f not working
From: dsanson <dsanson@gmail.com>

As explained here:

    https://github.com/dsanson/s6clean/issues/#issue/1

commands like

    $ slideshow -f http://github.com/geraldb/slideshow-s5-blank/raw/master/s5blank.txt

don't seem to be working: github returns a 301 error and fails to
download s5blank.txt. It is easy enough to install manually by cloning
the github repo to ~/.slideshow/templates.

Perhaps the problem is that github is redirecting to https?

   $ wget http://github.com/geraldb/slideshow-s5-blank/raw/master/s5blank.txt

redirects to https, and then chokes complaining that "certificate
common name `*.github.com' doesn't match requested host name
`github.com'." And

   $ slideshow -f https://github.com/geraldb/slideshow-s5-blank/raw/master/s5blank.txt

fails with an

   *** error: 400 Bad Request

Best,
David
