I just downloaded and tried out your new version. It works well.
Thanks!

A couple of comments:

(1) I understand the decision to go with the markdown to html
conversion rather than markdown to s5. An unfortunate side-effect is
that pandoc only generates the "incremental" classes when it is
generating s5. So one of the benefits of using pandoc-ruby is lost
(see <https://groups.google.com/group/webslideshow/browse_thread/
thread/6d425bbbfc6b9810/>). Also, it means you can remove the gsub in
markdown.rb. (On a related note, I, like Bruce D'Arcus, would like to
see support for "incremental" in addition to "step", for compatibility
reasons...)

(2) My motivation for disabling the percent-style comments was to make
use of pandoc's metadata block. When pandoc generates s5 it
automatically generates a title page: <h1>Title</h1><h3>Author</
h3><h4>Date</h4> from this metadata. But it doesn't do that when it
generates plain html, so given your implementation, there is no reason
to disable percent-style comments. Pandoc users should just switch to
using yaml metadata blocks when using slideshow.

These comments relate to a few of features I'd love to see in
slideshow :-)

(1) Some way to indicate, in the markdown source, that a list should
be a "step" list.

Pandoc's method is a bit of a kludge: when generating s5, list
elements inside of blockquotes become incremental lists. When
generating plain html, they become lists inside of blockquotes.

Indeed, I think this is potentially a rather tortured issue. In a
previous discussion on this list (linked above), you said that this is
probably something that would be done best by extending the markdown
syntax used by the converter. I think I agree. In a perfect world, I
would be able to write a slideshow in markdown and convert it to an
html presentation in any one of several supported formats, a PDF
presentation (e.g., via LaTeX's beamer package), a Keynote
presentation, a Powerpoint presentation, etc. And, from the same
source, I would be able to produce an outline or handout in any one of
several supported formats.

But I don't see this happening anytime soon! So, in the meantime,
perhaps something like:

    +    list item {.step}

Both pandoc and rdiscount pass the {.step} part through untouched. So
it would be a matter of writing a filter to find <li>...{.step}</li>
and convert it into <li class="step">...</li>. But maruku (in a quick
test) seems to strip it out. So this might not work for all
processors.

So maybe it would be easier to just implement another one of the
features I'd love to see:

(2)  A command-line switch to make all lists "step" lists.

This doesn't raise any of the issues raised by trying to extend
markdown, and would handle 90% of my needs.

Finally, I'd love to see

(3)  A command-line switch to generate a "title" slide from the yaml
metadata at the top of the file.

Just something simple. It is easy to use CSS in a theme to target the
first slide to make it pretty. But ideally, the slide would be given a
unique id (e.g., "titlepage"), so a theme wouldn't make the mistake of
styling a first slide a title page when it isn't. (My s6clean will
make this mistake, as currently written.)

I'm well aware that all additional features come at a cost. This is
just the wish-list of one user! Take it or leave it as you see fit :-)
