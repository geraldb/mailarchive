Subject: Best for mobile devices?
From: Keith <keith@setuplinux.com>
To: "Free Web Slide Show Alternatives - S5, S6, S9, Slidy, FullerScreen, Codex, and Friends" <webslideshow@googlegroups.com>
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

What's the best alternative to use for mobile devices with
touchscreen?

S5 will let me "tap" the screen to move through slides, but you can't
go back.  So I'm trying to find the best solution that works in IE8/
Firefox/Chrome as well as on mobile phones such as iPhone and Android
and will let you use your finger to swipe to go forward or back.

Thanks for any help/suggestions.
