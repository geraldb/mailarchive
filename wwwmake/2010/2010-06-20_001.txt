Subject: Pro and Cons of Slideshow (S9), Showoff and Keynote by Clayton Parker

Hello,

  Just found that Clayton Parker has written up a story about the the
pro and cons of Slideshow (S9) and Showoff and how the two free
alternative Ruby packages compare to Apple's Keynote.

  The pros listed for Slideshow (S9) include:

  * Use Markdown or Textile to write slides
  * Can be version controlled
  * Nice support for themes

  And the cons listed include:

  * Bases slides on headers, no way to have a slide without a header
  * Default style is quite horrific
  * Adding images to a presentation is a pain
  * No PDF export option natively
  * No way to easily preview changes (requires HTML generation)
  * No way to link to a specific slide
  * Syntax highlighter supports a limited set of languages
  * Syntax highlighting inclusion is dirty
  * Syntax highlighting default styles are no good
  * No fancy transitions
  * No presenter display

   If you have any ideas, wishes, suggestions on how to improve the
Slideshow (S9) package, let me know.

  Cheers. Gerald
