Subject: Which slideshow to use?
From: mrben <ben.thorp@gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm in the process of planning/building a new project, based on
Django, that will generate a browser-based slideshow as part of it's
output. I was already aware of S5, but suddenly there are so many
other options, that I'm a bit confused!

Ultimately I want to use what is most extensible, so I'm leaning
towards S6 at the moment, as I have some experience with jQuery, but
thought I would ask here to see if anyone had any helpful tips.

The other main thing to note is that I will be looking to implement
'dual-screen' type functionality, a bit like what is used in the s5key
demo ( http://www.snook.ca/technical/s5key/ ), and I'm also hoping to
add some additional keystrokes if possible, which is why extensibility
is so important.

Any thoughts gratefully received

mrben
