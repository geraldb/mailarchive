Subject: Gradient Background Missing
To: webslideshow@googlegroups.com

I feel like I am missing something.

According to http://slideshow.rubyforge.org/themes.html, the Markdown
shown between the -------- lines should generate a gradient
background:

----------------------
gradient: top-bottom red black

This Is The First Slide
=======================

----------------------

With the s6.txt template, I see no background at all in Chrome or
Firefox. Moreover, I don't see any evidence of background instructions
in the generated content, though I certainly don't claim to grok all
of it.

I have also tried replacing "gradient: top-bottom red black" with
"gradient-colors: green lime" with the same results.

If I switch to the s6gradient.txt template, I get a gradient
background, but only on Firefox. That part I understand, but it also
means that my Markdown is (presumably) correct. Hence, I can't quite
figure out where I am going haywire with the default template.

Any suggestions?

Thanks!
