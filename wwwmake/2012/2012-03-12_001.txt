Subject: Force S9 to use a given markdown library

Perhaps I missed it, but is there an easy way to force S9 to use a given 
markdown implementation?  I have several markdown gems installed for 
various reasons and s9 always seems to choose rdiscount.  If I'd like to 
utilize kramdown for example, is there an easy way to do so?

Thanks!
