Hey,

A question, maybe anyone has an answer here.
I'm looking for a html5 slideshow framework that I can use to create 
dynamic slideshows
(e.g. with forms + javascript functionality, etc)

I like deckjs pretty much, but I would like to combine it somehow with 
coffeescript (for the dynamic stuff)
as well as markdown or haml.

Can anyone suggest anything like that?
I like keydown and showoff - but couldn't find anything for the above 
task...

Thanks a lot,
Christoph
