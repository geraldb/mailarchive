Subject: ANN: deck.rb - slides in markdown, using deck.js and rack

deck run foo.md bar.md
open http://localhost:4333

Did the world need another markdown-to-html presentation tool?
Probably not, but I wrote one anyway.

I've been using (and contributing to) showoff but have grown unhappy
with the codebase and release cycle. I admit I haven't done all my
homework so this may be mostly redundant with Keydown or Slideshow or
what have you, and I'm open to joining forces with any other projects.
This is surely alpha software but I've been using it reliably for a
few months now.

Here's what deck.rb has to offer:

* uses deck.js, which is the cleanest HTML5 slide presentation engine
I've found (no offense to S6 or Showoff but Deck's got Jasmine tests)
* supports Markdown, but it should be easy to add other formats
* presentations can span several source files
* source files look good as source, built HTML, preview HTML, or as a deck =
doc
  * each H1 designates the beginning of a new slide
  * explicit `!SLIDE` or `<!SLIDE>` directives can split slides too
  * generated HTML is pretty-printed for easier "view source"
  * links to auxiliary files (e.g. `img src`) are resolved relative to
the source file -- no more broken images in markdown previews!
* add CSS classes to slides inside the slide directive =97 e.g. <!SLIDE
center> gives <section class=3D"slide center">
* mostly backwards-compatible with Showoff
  * specifying 'showoff.json' on the command line loads all slides in
its 'sections' section
* code syntax highlighting using Coderay
  * specify language at the top of the block using either ::: or @@@
  * e.g. `@@@ ruby`
* uses RedCarpet markdown extensions, including tables and fenced code bloc=
