Counter arguments:

While text is great, there isn't much control over layout.

* yes you can do some things with CSS

* yes you can do some things such as raw html code.  E.g. for my website at 
http://sherwoods-forests.com in the templates I use the construct:

<DIV class=pictureright>

![Image text][1]

[1]: /Image/path/to/pic.jpg

This text is the caption

***

</div>

But if I want to output another format, I have to use html as an 
intermediate format.

AFAIK there is no way to do magazine type layout:  Images that span 
columns, flow from one column to the next, pull quotes, multicolumn layout.

*  Dialects of MD have support for various types of footnotes, and some for 
math in the form of latex, but try to get an html document that looks 
remotely like one of the standrd journal formats.  

* How do you create a table of contents in MD?

* How do you create an index in MD, expecially with entries where you want 
to index foo both under F, and under bar -> foo?

*  MD because it sees the world through html coloured glasses makes no 
distinction between semantic and layout content.  (Neither does HTML -- 
that's why)  

To be a one source solution, you have to be able to have the level of 
control that you have for paper.

I suspect that conceptually the answer is similar to that of InDesign.  You 
have a 'story editor' that speaks markdown.  These compile to some form of 
intermediate XML.  Fletcher's MMD does this already.  And you have some 
form of page description language that consists mostly of box descriptions, 
meta-box descriptions and rafts of include  files from the stories.

Markdown is not complete by itself.
