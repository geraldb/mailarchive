Dear all,
is there a link for a ready-to-use open beer db file (e.g. as text file)? I 
am new to this topic and I a bit lost. I would like to put the data into 
elasticsearch and analyse it in kibana. And I was thinking there should be 
a file / snapshot with the data without having to create it myself and it 
does not matter if it is 6 months old.

Can someone help, please?

Thanks for any input!
