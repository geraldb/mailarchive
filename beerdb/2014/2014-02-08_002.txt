Hello,

   The text format works like a wiki, that is, the beer and brewery
plain text files are hand crafted with the idea for easy reading and
writing (you can add comments, blank lines, use multi-line records,
etc.), that is, they are not really designed for simple database
dumps.

   Anyways, you're welcome for new countries and regions to try to
generate the files first and let's see how this works out.  The format
is basically a better (improved) version of comma separated values.
I started to document the format at the csv2 site [1]       The main
idea is to use folder and file name conventions for countries and
regions and than  use single-line or multi-line comma separated value
records  where simple text patterns are used for types (e.g. alcohol
by volume uses %, original gravitiy uses =B0,  [0-9]{4} is the founding
year, // is used for the address line etc.)

  Cheers.
