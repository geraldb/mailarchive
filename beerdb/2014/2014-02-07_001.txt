Hi Gerald,

Excellent. I'll do that.

One issue, you provide a ruby utility, however I will be building a 
web-based front-end to this data, and would like to automate exporting of 
added data into your format. Do you provide the schema of the text db 
format anywhere, and if not can you either add that somewhere within the 
notes, or reply with it here? That way I can honour your format but work 
with the data in my database, otherwise it'll be an import only and 
exporting will be difficult.

Thanks,

Derek
