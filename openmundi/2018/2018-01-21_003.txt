Hi, I'm interested in using the data posted in factdb, but I'm quite 
confused about how to properly use the database and I can't find much in 
the way of a manual or tutorial.

First, if there is a good manual/tutorial please point me to it and I'll 
read through it thoroughly. If not, then here are my questions:

1. I see there are separate pages for factdb, openmundi, world.db, etc. 
What is the relationship between these? Are they different (outdated) 
versions of the same thing? Or part of a larger parent project, etc.?

2. As someone who is familiar with coding/terminal/scripting, but not 
familiar with json or working with databases, what is the proper way to use 
and access the data?

3. Would it be possible to post a dump of all the data to a csv file or 
similar? Ultimately I want to have a data table where rows are countries 
and columns are all categories. It would also be ok to have one master json 
file which I can then parse in R. Alternatively, if you could even just 
tell me conceptually the right steps to follow to get to this result, I can 
probably figure out the rest myself.

Thank you for maintaning this project!
