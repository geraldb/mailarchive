Hello Gerald,

I ran the factbook gem on all 268 entries of the WFB over the weekend and 
was stuck with about half a dozen empty JSON files (server timeout?) for 
which I had to re-run the scraper.

It would be useful to have an option "geos_path" or something to scrape the 
local copy of a file in the factbook/geos/ directory instead of downloading 
it on the fly. 

Just a suggestion for 0.1.4. What do you think?

Greetings
