Gerald,

your Factbook gem works like a charm. To make it more useful I have two 
suggestions.

Each field has its own ID. I would suggest to include this ID in the 
JSON output. Doing so would bring several benefits:

  * the Factbook contains descriptions for all fields which could be
    referenced/downloaded/extracted using this ID. The field description
    could also be used to create a mapping "field_names_used_in_JSON" to
    their respective original text (or: as an alternative, the original
    field name could be included in the output itself)
  * the Factbook contains text tables containing the raw data for
    numeric fields, so there is no need to sanitize the fields to get
    their numeric values.  To reference these raw data tables the field
    ID is needed
  * the Factbook contains field listings (the compiled values of fields
    for all countries). To reference these tables the field ID is
    needed, again

Finally, I suggest to include a pseudo section in the JSON output along 
the line
"header" : {
    "country" : "Austria",
    "fips" : "at"
}
to make the entries more descriptive / self-contained (to be located at 
the top, before intro).

I the gem were written in Python I would already have started to 
implement these improvements myself. But as I am no rubist (and too old 
to ever become an "old ruby hand") all I can do (at this point) is to 
point out the benefits an updated gem would provide...

What do you think?

Cheers

Eckhard
