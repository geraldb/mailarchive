Subject: [ALT] Glean - Data Management Tool for Humans w/ Tom Markup and
 GitHub Repos

Hello,

  FYI: Just stumbled across Glean. The project blurb reads:

  Glean targets human curated datasets, with a goal of easy collaboration.

  Data is stored in the human readable data format, TOML. You can
think of it as Markdown for data. Each dataset is stored in a git
repository, which makes it easy to track revisions, propose changes,
and collaborate on datasets.

 Each file represents one piece of data (a hash of hashes). Filenames
and directory structure are not significant to the data, but are
useful for organization and human collaboration via Pull Requests.

  More @ github.com/glean

 Some first data sets include:

  - countries
  - us-states

  And the glean command line tool lets you export the dataset in json
or yaml, for example:

  $ glean export countries --format=json
  {"name":"Andorra","code":"ad"}
  {"name":"United Arab Emirates","code":"ae"}
  ...

  $ glean export us-states --format=yaml
  --- !ruby/hash:Hashie::Mash
  name: Alaska
  abbreviation: ak
  --- !ruby/hash:Hashie::Mash
  name: Alabama
  abbreviation: al
  ...

  If you know any other alternatives or if you try out Glean, let us
know what you think?  Or any ideas on how to make it easier to manage
data sets?  Cheers.
