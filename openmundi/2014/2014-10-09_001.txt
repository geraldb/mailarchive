Hello,

I posted a script that creates various formats from JSON files created by 
the Python based World Factbook scraper (wfbScraper.py), see 
https://github.com/openfactbook/master/tree/master/tools for 
details.Supported formats are currently markdown (default), plain text and 
custom LaTeX.

The script reads a country profile via stdin and writes the result to 
stdout. The script is also compatible with JSON files created by Gerald's 
factbook gem. However, references to external media (flags, locators and 
maps) in the created files require header information which are only 
provided by wfbScraper.py.

Enjoy.
