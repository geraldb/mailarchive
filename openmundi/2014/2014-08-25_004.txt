Hello Gerald,

OK, so I will set up a repo for the Open World Factbook eventually. I am 
not there yet and currently rather busy, so it will take a few weeks.

I think the Open World Factbook repo will start with JSON w/ long form 
field names and headers, the media referenced,  and the necessary tool 
chain to convert the JSON entries to LaTeX, pdf, md, html and plain txt. I 
am still thinking about to host the converted results somewhere and to 
extend the tool chain for inculsion of a dictd dictionary although the 
dictd concept is a bit outdated having wikipedia and its siblings around... 
Maybe epub would be another option.

Cheers
