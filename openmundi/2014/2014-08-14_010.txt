Gerald,
 
I just found your Factbook gem and the Factbook JSON repo. Thanks for the 
work -- I was about to write a similar tool in Python.
 
Are you planning to update the JSON repo regularly or is this supposed to 
be a one-time snapshop? I am asking because I had written a similar HTML 
scaper for the factbook more than a decade ago. Unfortunately, the HTML 
pages provided by CIA were changing rather rapidly at that time so I gave 
up to update my scraper eventually. Hope that the pages are a bit more 
stable these days so that your tool stays useful quite a while.

The repo contains 194 entries for the independent states plus entries for 
the European Union and the world. Shouldn't it contain (for the sake of 
completeness) the 55 additional entries for dependent territories as 
recognized by ISO (in ISO 3166-1) and which are usually found in other geo 
databases, e.g. geonames.org, statoids.com, naturalearthdata.com etc.? 
Anyway, good work, thanks again.

Keep up the good work
 
Eckhard Licher
