Gerald,
 
I just found your Factbook gem and the Factbook JSON repo. Thanks for the 
work -- I was about to write a similar tool in Python.
 
Are you planning to update the JSON repo regularly or is this supposed to 
be a one-time snapshop? I am asking because I had written a similar HTML 
scaper for the factbook more than a decade ago. Unfortunately, the HTML 
pages provided by CIA were changing rather rapidly at that time so I gave 
up to update my scraper eventually. Hope that the pages are a bit more 
stable these days so that your tool stays useful quite a while.
 
Keep up the good work,
 
Eckhard Licher
