Gerald,

I agree with you in principle. 

However, several parts are related, so they have to fit in a fixed 
directory structure. This is particularly true for all who want to use the 
build scripts to reproduce the derived format(s).

What I am up to and what should be contained in a single directory is 
described in the attached file README.md, which itself is work in progress.

The factbook.ruby github page has a nicely structured overview over the WFB 
contents in README.md. I will use that for the TOC of the "*Open* world 
factbook" (working title). Is the text in README.md derived from (JSON) 
data? If so, could you post it?

Cheers

# The _Open_ World Factbook -- The contents of the World Factbook in various data formats
 
## Introduction

The _Open_ World Factbook  aims to provide the contents of the
World Factbook (referred to as WFB) invarious formats to enable it 
to be used very easily.

In addition, the tools and procedures to update the data in this repo are 
provided. (To be done).

The World Factbook is in the public domain. Accordingly, it may be copied 
freely without permission of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). 
The tools provided in this repository are dedicated to the public domain 
by their respective author(s) as well.


## Naming conventions

The files related to geographic entities are named strictly as follows:

    * two lower case letters containing the FIPS code, e.g. ``gm`` for Germany
      and ``au`` for Austria (as opposed to the ISO 3166-1 alpha2 codes
      ``de`` and ``at`` respectively).
      
    * file extension in lower case, e.g. ``.html`` for ``HTML`` files,
      ``.md`` for files in markdown notation. 


## Contents of this repo


### Directory ``geos.json/``

The contents of the WFB in ``JSON`` format as produced by Gerald's 
[factbook gem](https://github.com/worlddb/factbook.ruby)
version 0.1.3, with long field names option. 


All other file format versions are derived from the files in this directory


### Directory ``geos.latex/``

The contents of the WFB converted from ``JSON`` format to ``LaTeX`` macro calls
by homebrew script. 

...


### Directory ``templates/``

Sample ``LaTeX`` templates contaning, in addition to the necessary 
boilerplate code, the macro definitions for the macros called from files 
contained contained in ``geos.latex``. 

File ``sample.tex`` is used to create a ``.pdf`` file for a single entity.

File ``master.tex`` is used to create a ``.pdf`` for the collection of 
**all** (268) entities in the WFB (some 2700 pages in case you asked. YMMV). No annexes yet.

...


### Directory ``work/``

Working directory containig customized boilerplate files created from
template, used as working directory for ``pdflatex`` mass conversion.

...


### Directory ``geos.pdf/``

The contents of the WFB created with ``pdflatex`` from the files in 
``geos.latex`` and ``work``.

...


### Directory ``geos.md/``

The contents of the WFB converted from ``JSON`` format to markdown notation, 
w/ references to flags, locators and maps (for the time being hard-coded in ``HTML`` syntax) by
homebrew script.

...


### Directory ``geos.html/``

The contents of the WFB converted from markdown to ``HTML`` using ``markdown_py``. 

...


### Directory ``geos.txt/``

The contents of the WFB converted  from ``JSON`` format to 
easily readable plain text using a homebrew script. The
``.txt`` files provided are somewhat easier to read than the output
of ``lynx --dump``.

...


### Directory ``flags/``

Flags  in ``.gif`` format as contained in directory 
``graphics/flags/large/`` of the download version, renamed 
according to the naming conventions.

...


### Directory ``flags.png/``

Flags converted to ``.png`` format with 2 pixel
border in darkgrey applied using the Imagemagick tools.

...



### Directory ``locator/``

Overview maps  in ``.gif`` format as contained in directories
``graphics/locator/*/`` of the download version of the WFB, copied to a flat
directory and renamed according to the naming conventions.

...


### Directory ``locator.png/``

Overview maps converted to ``.png`` format, white background and 2 pixel
border in darkgrey applied using the Imagemagick tools.

...


### Directory ``maps/``

Maps  in ``.gif`` format as contained in directory 
``graphics/maps/`` of the download version, renamed 
according to the naming conventions.

...


### Directory ``maps.png/``

Maps converted to ``.png`` format using the Imagemagick tools.

...


### Directory ``meta/``

Miscellaneous mappings and other metadata.

...


### Directory ``tools/``

The specific scripts used to create the various file formats in this repo
and other goodies.

Not yet ready for release. 



### Directory ``docs/``

Work in progress. To be done.



## Next steps

Some ideas:

    * incorporate ``JSON`` created by the 
      [factbook crawler](https://github.com/twigkit/worldfactbook-dataset).
      The crawler is useful as it sanitizes the scanned data fields
      and provides a clean interface to access numerical field values
      
    * create a mapping between the two different JSON datasets. 
    
    * ...
    
    
## External sources and references

To be done. There is some very interesting stuff out there ...
