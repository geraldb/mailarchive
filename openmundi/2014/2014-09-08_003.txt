Hello,

I just set up a new repo on github: 
https://github.com/elicher/openWorldFactbook

The initial upload contains just sanitized content (text in 2 formats, 
graphics). The tools employed and such will be added over time. 

The files in the repo are organized so that various formats can be derived 
from the files in geos.md/ instantly, using pandoc 
(http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/), e.g. html, plain text, latex, epub and 
MS Word's .docx (even the graphics are included). 

More sophisticated results will be possible for everyone once the toolchain 
is in place. As a preview 
http://messetool.vdma.org/messetool/cal/view_static/en/index.md should 
suffice. Thanks to the typesetting experience integrated into the LaTex 
typesetting system the .pdfs are much more readable than the original .pdfs 
...

Enjoy
