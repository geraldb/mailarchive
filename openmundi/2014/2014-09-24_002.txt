Hello Gerald,

FYI, I have completed the python WFB scanner so that it outputs all 
information needed to re-master an entity's entry in the WFB. The scanner 
outputs ``JSON`` structured very similar to the JSON output of your gem. 
The differences are described here: 
https://github.com/openfactbook/geos.json/blob/master/README.md

On the Python side, beautiful soup is an add-on to and comaptible with 
various existing HTML/XML parsers. Currently only the parser from the 
standard Python library was tested which is extremely slow but said to be 
very lenient (forgiving). Maybe faster (and less lenient) parsers work as 
well, but I kind of doubt it. The original markup is anything but clean and 
elegant ...

I will now brush up the tools a bit so they can be posted and will take 
over the two repos soon.

Cheers
