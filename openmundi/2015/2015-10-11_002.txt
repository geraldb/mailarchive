Gerald,

I have almost given up on the World Factbook -- HTML changes every year 
made the WFB an extremely moving target to scan. Having created scanners 
for at least 4 HTML versions in the last one and a half decades I was about 
to give up. I was even checking the openmundi group for news ever less 
frequently. 

Having checked this morning I am happy to see important progress. 
Particulary the path taken in de-chroming the crufty original markup seems 
to be very promising for the near to mid-term future.

So thanks A LOT for the de-chromed html version. The cleaned-up html pages 
seem to scan nicely with my python bs4-based scanner (unmodified). I need 
to do some more tests but the preliminary results are very promising. Only 
scanning the header information from the de-chromed html pages needs to be 
changed. But this is a piece of cake, obviously.

Before updating my toolchain, making it reliant on your de-chromed html 
pages, I would like to know your update policy for these pages. If you are 
going to produce at least annual updates I will follow and create .json, 
.md, .html, .tex and other versions from these on a regular basis as well.

Once again, thanks a lot for the good work. Keep it up. 

Eckhard
