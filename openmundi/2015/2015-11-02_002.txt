Hi,

been taking a look at this which looks most interesting. First learned of 
this when Gerard post on the SQLite list. Downloaded the archive, extracted 
and ran the recommended 'gem install factbook'. DOH! I ran it againg with a 
sudo and at least then I had write permissions to the lib64 tree. Running 
again produced the following output:

Fetching: logutils-0.6.1.gem (100%)
Successfully installed logutils-0.6.1
Fetching: fetcher-0.4.5.gem (100%)
Successfully installed fetcher-0.4.5
Fetching: mini_portile-0.6.2.gem (100%)
Successfully installed mini_portile-0.6.2
Fetching: nokogiri-1.6.6.2.gem (100%)
Building native extensions.  This could take a while...
ERROR:  Error installing factbook:
        ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension.

*System: openSuse 13.1Ruby: 2.0.0p247 (2013-06-27) [x86_64-linux]Gem: 2.0.3*
I know very little about ruby so thought I'd ask here before diving in. 
There was a gem_make.out file mentioned too but it just repeated the error 
relating to missing header. Cheers.
