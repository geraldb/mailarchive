Hello,

I want to find out how many assists there are in a league per season in 
order to compare it to how many goals there are in that league per season. 
Is there a resource that will allow me to do this either by adding the 
number of assists for all of the players in the league together or counting 
the number of assists per game?

Thank you,

Lars
