Hello,

First of all, I love the work! This could be exactly what I need for a 
small project. However, I've noticed that the auto-updates for 
footballcsv/england stopped on 1 Dec 2020 (update 49). Are there any plans 
to update these tables in the future? I need 2020/21 League One and Two 
information and cannot find this anywhere else.

Many thanks,
Sammy
