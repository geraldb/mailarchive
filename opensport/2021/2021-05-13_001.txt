Hi Gerald, thanks for answering so quickly and sorry i couldn't get back to=
=20
you sooner.

I was following the exact steps, no extra script or anything, just using=20
the $ sportdb new worldcup command inside an empty directory.

I got a somewhat working file that was the query to build the database but=
=20
not the content itself. Am i missing something? something that i should=20
have installed and i didn't?
