Hi Gerald, 

I've been trying to download the England database using the '$ sportdb new 
eng' command, however I'm getting the following error:

*league >English Division One<, season >2000/01<*


*** !!! ERROR - no league match found for >English Division One<, add to 
leagues table; sorry*
**** error: exit*

Which means that only season 2010/11 is loading at the moment.

I have successfully downloaded it in the past, but I'm not sure how to 
overcome this error (I'm not very experienced with programming!). Any help 
would be very much appreciated. Thank you for making such a fabulous data 
resource so accessible - it's amazing!

Best wishes,
R.
