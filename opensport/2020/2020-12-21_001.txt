I would like to know if you have a database that provides game statistics 
per player. how many passes the player tried, how many he hit in the game, 
the total distance traveled by the player during the game, how many minutes 
the player stayed on the pitch ...
I looked for such questions in the group and found some unanswered many 
years ago.
