Folks,

I am a passionate football fan, and also happen to work on a product called 
DoltHub. Briefly, Dolt is an open source database with Git-like features. 
It's as if MySQL and Git had a baby. It provides a Git-like experience for 
tables of data. DoltHub is a product that provides a collaboration platform 
for Dolt data. Dolt is free, and always will be. DoltHub is free for open 
data.

I believe that Dolt and DoltHub provide an extremely elegant distribution 
model, very similar to Git, but for a relational database. Furthermore, 
when you get a Dolt repo, it's a functioning SQL database, so you can start 
doing analysis right away. It runs a MySQL Server instance, so it connects 
to the usual Pandas toolchain. Our CEO wrote a blogpost 
<https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2020-05-18-distribute-dolt-not-api/> about 
distributing data using Dolt and DoltHub, and we have an extensive 
documentation site <https://www.dolthub.com/docs>.

I notice many different files for different leagues and different years. I 
believe this project is calling for a unified database with different 
tables for leagues that provide different schemas, then possibly with views 
to make data uniform. Cloning Dolt data is easy:
$ dolt clone openfootball/club-football

Within such a repo we can imagine having tables for each league/country or 
whatever. Members of the community can make pull requests against DoltHub 
suggesting useful views. DoltHub empowers the maintainers of OpenFootball 
to keep total control of the repo, setting permissions appropriately.

Let me know your thoughts, we are happy to put some hours into this on our 
side.

-Oscar
