Hello everyone,
I am a research student in the Computer Science and Engineering Department 
at the University of Texas at Arlington. I am exploring the area of 
Spatio-Temporal effects on performance of sports (major sports such as 
football, soccer, basketball, tennis, baseball etc.). In order for me to 
conduct my research, I would require multiple datasets to examine, to 
identify interesting characteristics and find inferences. Hence, we would 
like to request you all for datasets that you know could be used in my 
project.

I am particularly interested in soccer (i.e. football) data sets, and would 
like to analyze critical elements in the players spatio-temporal movements 
and combinations that lead to important game events such as goals scored, 
goal attempts made, critical passes completed, critical clearances 
completed, and saves.

Thank you.
