Hi Gerald,

Great work! I am first and foremost a Barcelona fan ! 
I  have created a react app as a personal project to display football stats 
from top 5 leagues, UCL and other cup competitions. I was looking for some 
free way to get data. Those api endpoints are very slow. 

Today I found out your amazing work on openfootball. 

Now I can run my own server to serve my frontend ( That would be my 
back-end project as well ! )

I would really appreciate if you could tell me how to download 
football-to-sqlite command line tool.

Thanks and regards,
Nikhil BN

<br>
<br>    inspired by the datasette
<br>{db,dbf,markdown,geojson,shapefile}-to-sqlite series [1] I have put
<br>together the missing football-to-sqlite [2] tool that - surprise,
<br>surprise - lets you load / read football.txt match datafiles (e.g.
<br>English Premier League, German Bundesliga, Spanish La Liga 2020/21,
<br>etc.) into a sqlite database.
<br>
<br>Usage:
<br>
<br>Run this tool against match files in the Football.TXT format like so:
<br>
<br>```
<br>$ football-to-sqlite england.db 2020-21\1-premierleague.txt
<br>```
<br>
<br>or pass in more than one match file:
<br>
<br>```
<br>$ football-to-sqlite england.db 2020-21\1-premierleague.txt \
<br>                                2020-21\2-championship.txt  \

<br>                                2020-21\5-nationalleague.txt
<br>```
<br>
<br>
<br>Note: If the single-file SQLite database (and its tables, views &amp;
<br>indices) do not (yet) exist, they get auto-created on the first run.
<br>
<br>Note: You can use `football2sqlite` as an alias / alternate name.

<br>
<br>**Pipes &amp; Standard Input (STDIN)**
