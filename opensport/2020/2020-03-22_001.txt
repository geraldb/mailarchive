Recently discovered this football data base and thought id use it to learn=
=20
some sql.  I have downloaded Ruby and have added the following gem files:=
=20
activerecord, datafile, sqlite3, sportdb-models.

Not sure what step I have missed but I get the message

" 'sportdb' is not recognised as an internal or external command, operable=
=20
program or batch file"

I have tried creating the batch file that you gave to Guillaume Bleuz=C3=A9=
 (below)=20
and had problems with "no database file specified"

Please can you help, I have spent hours on this and got nowhere!
