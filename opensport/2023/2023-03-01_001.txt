Hello,

   No messages for years on the opensport group and I am under attack now 
and, thus,
trying to defend myself by backing-up all (google) groups that I 
administrate etc.

   The backup / archive will move to https://github.com/geraldb/mailarchive

   You can follow what I (Gerald Bauer) I am up-to at 
 https://geraldb.github.io/ 
   or at https://github.com/geraldb

    For support questions, please use the https://github.com/geraldb/help 
 repo (upcoming).  

   Questions and comments welcome.
   Prosit 2023!  Cheers.

PS: For the record this opensport group has 400 members and 397 posts.
