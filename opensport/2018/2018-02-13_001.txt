I'm intetested in the same thing, I am doing a project for an analytics 
course at a University in the USA.  I've been using Splunk and applying it 
to different publicly available datasets on other topics, but I'd like to 
heatmap premier league soccers matches and also look at passing 
attempts/completions/giveaways, all kinds of data.  I'll share what I find, 
and if my work has value I don't mind posting it.
