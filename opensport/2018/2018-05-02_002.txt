Hey everyone!
I'm just diving into the world of sports data and am overwhelmed by what is 
existing out there. So I have the impression the dataset I'm looking for is 
out there, but I haven't managed to find it yet. Maybe someone of you can 
point me at it or where best to look for it?
I am searching for a dataset that contains all football clubs in the world 
plus information on what leagues the club played in in 2014. If the "back 
in time" option is not available, it would also help to know what leagues 
they play in now. Any hints highly appreciated!
