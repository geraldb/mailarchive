Hello,
 I am an industrial engineer student in Belgium.
As part of a database lesson, I need to create a java (netbeans) 
application to manage and display data from my database.
We plan to display all data related to the world cups. I found your 
database very complete and i would like to use it.

But I do not understand how to create my database and import your data. I 
am not a fit of github.
I am on windows10, I use SQL Power Architect, pgAdmin 4 and postgreSQL 10.5 
and of course Netbeans (the only condition of the teacher).

Would you have a step to follow for the realization of my project?

Thank you
