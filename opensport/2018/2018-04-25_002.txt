Gerald, I understand your situation.  Much appreciate what you have done 
and continue to do.  Without you, we wouldn't have this data.  You have 
done a great job keeping it going all these years.

I like the direction of this project and this is your child and in order 
for it to grow, I think better documentation or create something simpler 
for more people to get to this data, in turn, it will then be more valuable 
to many and they would then put efforts in contributing.  I thikn they're 
not leaving you after getting the data, they will always need updated data, 
this is not a get something free and be done.  I think a lot of them just 
gave up all together. I know it's easy for me to speak my 2c worth because 
you were the one weathering the storms.  

at this point though, I'm not familiar enough with tools chosen so I may 
not be able to contribute to this.  I may branch out from your project to 
create something using either web based or standalone tools.

I saw that datafile message from Ben.  How do i add in the latest WCs?  
edit the history.txt?

how about the ground/city data? are they not parsed at this point?  I see 
all the games has NULL value as groundID and cityID.

Lance
