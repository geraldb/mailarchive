Basically, I cannot really find any file or good site online that I can 
extract league data from. All the files I have found are outdated and also 
not with the data I need. And since I don't know any programming I can't 
really know if this site has the data I need or not.

I just need all the PL results for all rounds. Hopefully going back to 1888.

All help will be appreciated. It's for a personal chart project.
