Hi,

First of all I am impressed with the amount of information and effort that 
was put into this project. Amazing and Congratulations for the good work.

I am trying to undertand how I can get and build a DB with Brazilian 
leagues results. I mean the repos I have to clone and steps I have to make 
in order to build the database that I want, and also if there is anyone 
maintaining Brazilian results.

Thanks
