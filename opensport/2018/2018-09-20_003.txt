Hi,=20

Thanks for your reply. I should have read the instructions :), Sorry about=
=20
it.

If I volunteer to maintain, it is just a matter of pull request ? Is there=
=20
any tools or processes in order to do that?=20

I found repo [1] (did not read yet) which I think is bare minimum=20
documentation I have to read in order to begin to understand the whole=20
project. Is this assumption correct?

Regards
Marcos

<br>=C2=A0 =C2=A0 The repo is setup to be &quot;self-contained&quot;, that =
