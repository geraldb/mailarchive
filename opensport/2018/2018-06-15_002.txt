I am skilled senior c# programmer. Now i am preparing a football real time 
program in c#
i am interested to query json of italian serie a league.
How to ? not programatically. That i know. But ... ? i would to know which 
url i must download to receive json of matches played of 2017-18 season and 
future 2018-19 where will be ready to query. 
Now i wrote a code like:
 using (var webClient = new System.Net.WebClient())
            {
                var json = 
webClient.DownloadString("http://footballdb.herokuapp.com/api/event/");
                // Now parse with JSON.Net
            }
Sure, the url isn't right. What's the correct url to query programatically 
to accomplish my request ?

Thx
