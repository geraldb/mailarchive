Hi all,

I had this same issue, the follwoing helped me:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28082120/how-to-downgrade-my-rails-version 

Essentially uninstalling ALL of rails (including railities) and then 
reinstalling a lower version.

I was then able to build using the shell script

Hope this helps someone

Thanks

Chris
