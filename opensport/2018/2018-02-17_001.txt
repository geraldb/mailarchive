Thanks! The more I dig into this project that you have built, its amazing 
the size and complexity. Although to be honest, its confusing since it 
spread out across so many different GitHub accounts. Let me explain what I 
am trying to build... 

I am building this... https://www.worldcupbrackets.info

Right now, it only has data for 2014, that I manually collected. I 
discovered your openfootball project and thought it would really help me 
build previous years pages. 

What is the best way for me to get the data? I am happy with just the 
SQLite databases or the JSON API to them if I can get that to work. I was 
only ever to create a database for the 2014 World Cup though.
