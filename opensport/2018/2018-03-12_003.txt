On executing sportdb build in world cup directory, you get non-empty goals 
table. When the same command is executed for es-espana, the goals tables is 
empty. Which means goals data is not present for anything but world cup. Do 
you think, we can bring in data about goals for every league ?

>> select * from goals; returns nothing for anything but world cup
