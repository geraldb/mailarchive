Thank you Gerald for a great project.  Navigating it s a pain though.  I 
read everything here and git for abotu 3 weeks now.  i didn't want to ask 
stupid questions, but i still have to :).  Found what Ben (another poster 
with similar problem) had for solution but still not understand enough to 
modify stuff.  I'm thinking of parsing myself but with this text format, it 
may take a bit of work.

The problem is that there's not documentation on how to use history.text so 
I'm not sure if i understand how to use the history.txt file with datafile.

Do you have a datafile that will build a 100% of data (everything that can 
be built including all historical, present and future data)? with 
everything in one go?  That will be very helpful.  I can understand what 
options are available to use in datafile.
