Gerald - first, massive thank you for the data set. Astonishing work.

Ben - I'm trying to do a similar thing to you. Generate a .db containing 
all historical WC games.  I'm trying to follow along this thread, but can't 
see how you got it working.

How did you parse sportdb this custom Datafile? What were the steps?

Recognise its been 18 months past, so you may not recall.
