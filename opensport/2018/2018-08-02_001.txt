Thanks. I don't want to analyse the data. That's really not interesting to 
me as I feel like this is better done by a million other people online.

I needed one huge file with ALL the rounds for PL. So that every single 
round and the points and goals scored all in all are there. And I got this 
data by scraping a football site with some scraping software. Then I used 
Tableau to make my chart. I didn't need to program anything for this at 
all. But it's just visual stuff really, nothing complicated math or even 
complicated PC stuff. Just using my mouse only.

I'm not really sure where else I could get this data. The sites you link to 
look interesting but I don't see what I need there as they have the matches 
only. But, I think maybe I can do something with this file of all the 
matches. I could scrape this data too but as I have it here I don't need to 
do that!!! And maybe I can make something visual out of this too? Either 
way, I love having this file.
