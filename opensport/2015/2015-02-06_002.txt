Hi Gerald,

Thank you so much for fixing the issue. I was able to download the latest 
repo and build it successfully. There is a quick setting change needed in 
the settings.rb file.
EN_INCLUDE_PATH          = "#{OPENFOOTBALL_ROOT}/eng-england"

Appreciate your help.

Regards,

- Maizar
