Gerald,
Thank you very much for the sportdb gem, although i am still in the process 
of learning it, it looks great!
about my question, your answer might help, but i have found my self needing 
to reinstalling all my .rvm anyway, so it works.

if you don't mind i have a couple of non related (to this post) questions:
1. are the game scores updated manually by you? 
2. do intend to on (re)updating the american football section?
3. any intentions on expansions for nba, mlb (baseball), etc?
4. and one last thing. and it might be there but i missed it, what is the 
best way to get your score updates (not live of course)? is there an api 
call?

thanks!
