hi, me and my friend are automating a soccer strategy. I have to scrap a 
betting website for live scores.

but the strategy needs to get fresh data every second! is it ok?

can you guide me , give general direction as to how to do this? what 
programming language to use, or maybe service?

any guidance would be much appreciated!
