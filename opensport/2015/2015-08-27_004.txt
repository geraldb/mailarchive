Gerard,

I finally did manage to import data without any errors and skipped matches.
The most problems I had is with adjusting teams.yml to match with the names=
=20
of the clubs in actual fixtures data.=20
Btw, Datafiles makes testing much easier.=20

My plan is to add information about goals scored in each match and to keep=
=20
up with current results (I have yet to figure how to better setup cron to=
=20
update them more or less automatically)

<br>=C2=A0 =C2=A0 As a follow-up to get you started with the import into an=
 SQL database:
<br>
<br>=C2=A0 =C2=A0The easiest way is to use a Datafile [1], for example, cre=
ate a new
<br>directory/folder
<br>=C2=A0 =C2=A0and put in an empty Datafile.
<br>
<br>=C2=A0 =C2=A0Now add something like:
<br>
<br>=C2=A0 inline do
<br>=C2=A0 =C2=A0 WorldDb::Model::Country.parse( &#39;ru&#39;, &#39;Russia&=
#39;, &#39;RUS&#39;, &#39;1 km=C2=B2&#39;, &#39;1&#39; )
<br>=C2=A0 end
<br>
<br>=C2=A0 football &#39;Kaspi/ru-russia&#39;
<br>
<br>&#39;
<br>=C2=A0 Now try to run it.
<br>
<br>=C2=A0 $ sportdb --verbose build =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=
=A0# will default to use the
<br>(local) Datafile; use the verbose debug switch
<br>
<br>=C2=A0 It should download your datasets as a zip archive.
<br>
<br>=C2=A0 As a next step you will have to add a setups/all.txt to your rep=
o e.g.
<br>
<br>setups/all.txt:
<br>
<br>=C2=A0 =C2=A0ru-russia!/leagues
<br>=C2=A0 =C2=A0ru-russia!/teams
<br>=C2=A0 =C2=A0ru-russia!/2014-15/rflp
<br>=C2=A0 =C2=A0ru-russia!/2015-16/rflp
<br>
<br>=C2=A0And than retry (best to clean out the local directory e.g. remove
<br>sport.db etc.) and the import should start working for real - next up
<br>is fixingthe remaing issues poping up. For example, rename your
<br>russian flp from teams.yml =C2=A0to rflp.yml in 2014-15 and 2015-16 and
<br>make sure you include a fixtures block (matching your fixtures/match
<br>schedule/results files) e.g.
<br>
<br>fixtures:
<br>- =C2=A0rflp-i
<br>- =C2=A0rflp-ii
<br>
<br>=C2=A0 Let us know how it goes or if you continue. Keep it up. Cheers.
