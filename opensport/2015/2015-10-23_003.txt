I just found out about football.db.  As I said, I'm new to this, but I am 
interested in being able to utilize this database to play around with some 
data visualization stuff.  I have no idea how to go about it.  How do I get 
the data off of these github repositories?  I want to use sqlite to query 
it.  I know MS SQL so I don't think I could figure out sqlite quite easily. 
 I just don't know how to create my own db with all of the data out on 
github.

Any help would be appreciated.  Thanks.
