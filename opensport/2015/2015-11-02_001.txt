Hello,

   Welcome to football.db. The best "recommended" and easiest way to
get started is using Datafiles [1]. First, of course, you need to
install the sportdb tool e.g.:

   $ gem install sportdb                 # will also install sqlite support

Now you can build yourself a database using Datafile. Example:

  $ sportdb new en             # get english premier league

 Will fetch zip archives from github and build the sport.db database.  Now try:

  $ sqlite3 sport.db
  > .tables
  >  select from * teams;
  > .exit

  I'd recommend starting with sqlite3 - if you're new to the sqlite3
command line you might try/use a visual tool - try SQLite Studio [2]
(it's free).

  The best way to get started is to get started and than if you have
more (new) questions post them here. Cheers.
