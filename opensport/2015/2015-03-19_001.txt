Hi all,

I found a reference to football.db on a stack exchange forum. I am hoping 
you might be able to help me.

I am trying to set-up a website for football fans - a site that will enable 
fans to chat to each other and exchange opinions.

I am looking for a data feed that includes the following info for the 
English Premier League and Championship:

1) A list of Premier League managers & players dating back to the 1992-3 
season.
 - To include name, age, number of appearances, honours, shirt number, 
goals scored, assists, disciplinary records etc...player profile 
information.
2) A list of Championship League managers & players dating back to the 
1992-3 season.
 - Same info needed
3) A feed for current season Premier League fixtures, date, match location 
& referee.

In time I might need to expand the feed to include other data points. 
However to start off I am keeping things simple and trying to minimise 
costs.

I am speaking to Opta however the prices seem exorbitant considering much 
of this info is already in the public domain.

Would I be able to use football.db to provide any of the data I need?

Many thanks,
Alan.
