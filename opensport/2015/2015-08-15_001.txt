Hi, I'm new to the group and the topic. Basically, I'm looking for more 
detailed stats about football games (preferably English Premier League). I 
can find scores, teams and players. However, I'm looking for stuff like:

* How many minutes the referee added at the end of the game
* How many yellow/red cards
* How many free kicks and at what times
* Penalty kicks, etc.

I know I'm asking for a lot, but was curious if anyone can point me in the 
right directly (even remotely).

Best regards,

Pocheto.
