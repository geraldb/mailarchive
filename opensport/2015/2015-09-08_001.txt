Subject: Re: [opensport] Is there a way to export from sqlite to the custom
 open football text format

Hello,
   Thanks for your efforts. Good point.

    Maybe I'm misunderstanding your question - if you have historical
datasets or datasets from other sources I suggest to import them as
is, that is,

    If you have datasets in CSV import the data in CSV
    If you have datasets in JSON import the data in JSON
    and so on.

    If you have specific datasets you want to import, let me know and
I can try to help out with the importer (code).

    I'm currently (as we speak;-) working on importing the (massive)
RSSSF datasets and working on the rsssf importer/scripts/machinery.

   Last week, for example, thanks to Alex we imported all squads
(players) from the Bundesliga in JSON.

   Sorry for any confusion about the "proper" format - the idea is if
you write and update your schedule by hand (that is,
wiki(pedia)-style), use the football.db format/style.  If you already
have datasets in JSON, CSV, RSSF, there's no need to reformat to the
plain text format before importing - "just" import the JSON, CSV, etc.

  Keep it up. Again just point the specific dataset and let's work
something out. Not sure if that answers your questins. Cheers.

PS: For a simple "recommended" csv format, see the footballcsv
repos.[1]  Sorry, haven't yet managed to add (code) the CSV importer
(but it's definitely planned/needed).
