Gerald,

Thank you for instructions. I pretty much figured all this from quite=20
descriptive error codes in sportdb.
I still have two problems with importing data.
First one is with importing world.db data. The import process hangs for=20
some reason. and it hangs in one particular line (city id 740 - guadalahara=
)
The second problem is with importing my russian league data. The process=20
give me a lot of info and warning messages (I posted the log here=20
https://github.com/Kaspi/ru-russia/blob/master/import.log) but when I run=
=20
'sportsb stats' it shows no info on matches and teams.

Thank you.

<br>=C2=A0 =C2=A0 As a follow-up to get you started with the import into an=

<br>
<br>=C2=A0 =C2=A0The easiest way is to use a Datafile [1], for example, cre=

<br>=C2=A0 =C2=A0and put in an empty Datafile.
<br>
<br>=C2=A0 =C2=A0Now add something like:

<br>=C2=A0 =C2=A0 WorldDb::Model::Country.parse( &#39;ru&#39;, &#39;Russia&=

<br>
<br>=C2=A0 football &#39;Kaspi/ru-russia&#39;

<br>=C2=A0 Now try to run it.

<br>
<br>=C2=A0 It should download your datasets as a zip archive.
<br>
<br>=C2=A0 As a next step you will have to add a setups/all.txt to your rep=
o e.g.
<br>
<br>setups/all.txt:
<br>
<br>=C2=A0 =C2=A0ru-russia!/leagues
<br>=C2=A0 =C2=A0ru-russia!/teams
<br>=C2=A0 =C2=A0ru-russia!/2014-15/rflp
<br>=C2=A0 =C2=A0ru-russia!/2015-16/rflp
<br>
<br>=C2=A0And than retry (best to clean out the local directory e.g. remove
<br>sport.db etc.) and the import should start working for real - next up
<br>is fixingthe remaing issues poping up. For example, rename your
<br>russian flp from teams.yml =C2=A0to rflp.yml in 2014-15 and 2015-16 and
<br>make sure you include a fixtures block (matching your fixtures/match
<br>schedule/results files) e.g.
<br>
<br>fixtures:
<br>- =C2=A0rflp-i
<br>- =C2=A0rflp-ii
