I'm trying to set up a NodeJS server running on Heroku and pulling its data 
from a postgresql instance.

I now have a sport.db file that I would like to upload to the postgresql 
instance.  Reading some older posts in the group, I think others were 
successful and managed to simply pg push the data.

My problem is that it seems that I cannot push directly the sport.db and 
that I first need to dump the database into a file that postgresql can 
process.  If anybody has done it or knows how to do it, I would appreciate 
any pointers.

Thanks,
Joe
