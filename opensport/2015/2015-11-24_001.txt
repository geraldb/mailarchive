https://github.com/openfootball/world-cup has a lot of data I would like to 
access and use.

I've downloaded worldcup.db from 
https://github.com/openfootball/build/releases/tag/v2014.05.18

Is there a way to view the data in worldcup.db in something like 
phpMyAdmin? 

I'm sorry, I'm a total beginner. I'm very new to databases and github. I'm 
not sure at all how to start.

 I want to be able to get all the players from all the teams that have ever 
competed in any world cup and be able to put these players into a table in 
phpMyAdmin.
