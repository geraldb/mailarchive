Hello, thank you so much for replying. You say the datasets do not include 
any players, but https://github.com/openfootball/world-cup seems to have 
.txt files of all the players in all the teams that played each year. For 
example 
https://github.com/openfootball/world-cup/blob/master/1930--uruguay/squads/ar-argentina.txt 
seems to have the player names and their positions. Is this information 
just not yet incorporated into worldcup.db? 

If so, should I write my own parser of some sort to get the player names 
and positions?
