Hello,
New Year Greetings. 
I wasn't aware that there was a mailing list (I was not keen enough) and 
submitted a suggestion at https://github.com/openfootball/players/issues/4
The basic idea I wish to suggest is that whether this data could be 
converted into formats that are easily parsed from a program
e.g. Formats such as TOML or YAML. 
This could readily enhance its usage and avoiding the need for manual 
parsing.
What are your ideas on this?
