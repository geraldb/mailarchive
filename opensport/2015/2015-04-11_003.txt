Hello,
   Thanks for retrying. Great news that it's working.

> if you don't mind i have a couple of non related (to this post) questions:

  Please check the FAQ page [1] that should cover most (some) question
in details. Some more comments follow.

> 1. are the game scores updated manually by you?

   For now there's now script for updates - it basically still kind of
by hand (manually). It works like a wiki.

> 2. do intend to on (re)updating the american football section?

  Not sure what you mean
     1) national football league ?  or
     2) major soccer league

    My current plan (focus) for the next weeks is a better build - the
idea is to get a daily build going or something. Plus include the
build of books (almancs) in the builds and so on.

> 3. any intentions on expansions for nba, mlb (baseball), etc?

  There's the opensport github org - see github.com/opensport  The
database schema should (more or less) work for all team sports - you
will need your own statistics tables etc.

4. and one last thing. and it might be there but i missed it, what is
the best way to get your score updates (not live of course)? is there
an api call?

    Good questions. There's no best way so far. Still trying out what
works best. So far now winner found. Try what works (best) for you.

 Cheers.
