Hi Gerald,

Thank you for the quick reply.  

The docs are a little spread out but everything you mentioned was in there. 
 I'd tried that way but I get too much data - the qualifiers and everything 
are in there, and it was only for the 2014 matches.

My question is more how to build  the historical world cup matches using 
sportdb, either individually or all together.  Is this possible?
