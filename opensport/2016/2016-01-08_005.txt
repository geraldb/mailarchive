Hi guys,
Recently, I finds football.db is amazing football database. I try to build 
my own database via https://github.com/openfootball/build. But I always 
faces message "Don't know how to build task 'worldcup'". I try to 
use https://github.com/openfootball/build-shell instead. It's seem 
everything ok. But my standing table is empty. How can I update my standing 
table data.
I really appriciate for your help. Thanks you.
