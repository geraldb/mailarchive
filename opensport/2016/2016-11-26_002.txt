Hi Gerald,

I just finished my project and thought you'd like to see the 
results: http://benburlingham.com/d3-worldcup/

The data was quite good (I double-checked all of the games) except for 
1934; I think there is a problem with the way the score is parsed into the 
database.

Anyway, all done now, thank you for your help and code and best of luck 
with your work!

Ben
