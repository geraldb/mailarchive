I have a  proposal concerning the User Experience of the site: please add 
approx number of items in tables in the section "schema diagram" of 

https://openfootball.github.io/


It would be easy to do, and add valueable information to database admins 
and power users. 

For instance, if table size were be available at a glance, I for one would 
instantly know which table joins were expensive. 

Maybe it could look like this :

I've just made the numbers up. And clearly almost everybody knew that these 
numbers are constantly changing .

Note that I know that I could easily find this out myself, and indeed I 
know how to do this. I am not asking for help here. Instead, I just wanted 
to communicate my first impression after visiting the site for the first 
time. 


Keep up the great work!
