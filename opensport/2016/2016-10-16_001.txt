Yes, that's exactly it - I'm very close.

I'm using sportdb build with a datafile and it looks like things are on the 
right track.

A few pieces of friendly feedback before I forget:
- It was a little unclear at the beginning not to use "sportdb new worldcup"
- The builder doesn't check for existence of the zip files so I had to 
download them again every time I ran the command

Anyway, I am running into this error now:

[info] parsing data in zip (fixture) 'world-cup!/1930--uruguay/cup' 
(world-cup-master/1930--uruguay/cup.yml)...
*** [DEPRECATED] old event config format w/ yaml, please use new plain text 
format >world-cup-master/1930--uruguay/cup.yml<
[fatal] event reader - team keys: ["arg", "bra", "bol", "chi", "uru", 
"per", "par", "mex", "usa", "fra", "yug", "bel", "rou"]
[fatal] event reader - record for team key >yug< not found

My .Datafile:
world  'world.db', setup: 'countries'
football 'national-teams'
football 'world-cup', setup: 'history'
