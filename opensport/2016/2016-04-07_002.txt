I'm using XAMPP to run both apache web server and mysql database. I'm 
trying to use PHP in html files to access the databases in MariaDB. I'm 
having trouble populating the database in MariaDB with the world cup db 
file. I exported it as sql file but the format doesn't match MariaDB. I 
tried accessing SQLite using XAMPP but I'm running into trouble there. I've 
seen posts on using "rake"? I'm not sure what that does. All I'm trying to 
do is add the world cup db file to MySQL so that I can use XAMPP to access 
it using PHP.
