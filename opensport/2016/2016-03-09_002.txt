Hi,

First of all, this project is awesome. Really love it and thanks for making 
the data available is such a convenient to use way.
I wonder if you have any plan to update the *footballcsv* repositories to 
include more recent data?
I haven't looked into details but from my understandings these are 
generated files so me sending a manual pull request probably won't be so 
useful.
