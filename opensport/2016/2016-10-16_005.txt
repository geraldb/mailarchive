Hi Gerald, thank you for your work on building and publishing these 
datasets!

I'm interested in how to use sportdb to generate datasets for the text 
files found at https://github.com/openfootball/world-cup.

The README says "use the sportdb command line tool to build your own 
worldcup.db copy from the plain text data sets." but I haven't found 
resources on how to do that.

I've been digging around in various places:
- Built a sport.db file using a Datafile approach at 
https://github.com/openfootball/datafile, but it only contains the 2014 
data, and too much of it (has qualifiers and everything) 
- Tried Jokecamp's approach 
at https://github.com/jokecamp/sportdb-build-scripts but it seems to be 
similar to the above
- Used the pre-built releases 
at https://github.com/openfootball/build/releases but they don't have 2014 
data
- Experimented with the Rakefiles approach at 
https://github.com/openfootball/build but that didn't feel right

I seem to be missing the part on how to parse the individual text files, 
such as 
https://github.com/openfootball/world-cup/blob/master/1930--uruguay/cup.txt.

I'm close to writing my own parser to do it but wanted to check here first! 
Thanks for any help!
