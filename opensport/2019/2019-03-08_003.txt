Hi all,

I'm new in this forum, and trying to access the football.db database with 
Python and Django.

I followed the steps described here 
(http://openfootball.github.io/docs/python.html), and get stuck in point 3 
and 4:

3. Build the football.db SQLite database, as described elsewhere in this 
documentation
4. Configure Django. In particular, adjust the database settings to point 
to the football.db database

Where do I find such documentation ?

I checked everywhere and didn't find anything.

BTW, I was wondering if I have to download the entire database or if I can 
eventually run queries on football.db database server ?

Thanks
