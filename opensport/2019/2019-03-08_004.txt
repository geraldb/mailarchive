Hi all,
I'm new in this forum and trying to use football.db.
I followed the installation steps described here 
(http://openfootball.github.io/docs/python.html), until point 3 where it is 
written "Build the football.db SQLite database, *as described elsewhere in 
this documentation*" ... The same for point 4.
Where do I find the documentation for points 3 and 4 (I have no clue where 
to find it) ?
I was wondering whether I have to download physically all the football 
database or I can just run queries and they fetch data in the cloud ?
Thanks.
