Hello. 

Im kind of newbie in the RoR world. Have made some begginer pratice and 
trying to get better skils. 

Im not understanding how is the logic in the sportdb 

As example of my steps: 

I run the comand ' sportdb new worldcup2014' 

Everything looks fine with this execution. It generates a file called 
"sport.db" at my home directory

But when I try to see if my database is ok running the command "sqlite3 
.tables" everything is empty. 

How can i generate the Ruby Models of this data? I added the gem 
sportdb-models too, but didnt find how to make it. 

Thanks for any information. 

Cheers
