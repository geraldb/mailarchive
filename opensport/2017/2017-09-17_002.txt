Okay so I have managed to get the code working and it has built the 
database. Where has the database actually downloaded to? How can I open it 
in Access? All I see in the working directory is a DataBase File which 
cannot be opened by Access and some other random files.

So my question is How do I open the Database in Access so I can use it?

Thanks,

George

PS. Thanks Gerald for being so patient - you really are helping me out here 
:)
