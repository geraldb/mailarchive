Hi all,

First of all, thank you for this great effort. I'm new, both to Ruby and 
opensport, so sorry if my question is silly.

I had some problems with activerecord and json gems when running sportdb in 
the latest version of Ruby, so I managed to install and use rvm in order to 
run it in Ruby 1.9 and now is working.

When I run sportdb new all, I'm getting a lot of warnings about missing 
info:

...
[info] skipping line (no match found) ...
...
[warn] city with key wil missing


Finally, the process ends with the error:

[fatal] event reader - record for team key >moskva< not found


But, if I want to build a new database with only the info about Champions 
League, including historic data (all the data available in 
https://github.com/openfootball/europe-champions-league),
would you point me to the correct procedure to do it?

Thank you!
