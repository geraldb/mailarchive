Is there any free or paid USA soccer feed REST API which provide results in 
Spanish language?
I am working on a sports news feed app in which i have to show USA Soccer 
news feed in Spanish language. I found USA soccer news REST web service in 
English language but i need resulting content in Spanish language. I can 
purchase the web service if it is paid.
