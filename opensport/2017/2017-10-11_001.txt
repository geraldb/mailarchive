The team name "Ireland" is incorrect. There hasn't been a team called 
Ireland since 1950. The original Irish team, and local league and team (the 
Irish Football Association IFA), was confined mostly to the northern part 
of the island of Ireland. The Irish Free State - a part of the island of 
Ireland - then gained independence from the United Kingdom (circa 1921) and 
subsequently set up its own FA - the Football Association of Ireland (FAI) 
and a national team. The original Ireland team continued, headquartered in 
what was now Northern Ireland. The country that became independent then 
called their new national team "Ireland" as well. For a while, there 
existed two national teams called Ireland. In 1950, FIFA ruled that neither 
team could use the name Ireland. So the teams became "Northern Ireland" 
(NI, NIR) and the "Republic of Ireland" (IE, ROI, IRL). Also, the Northern 
Irish flag is missing from the Northern Ireland national team.
