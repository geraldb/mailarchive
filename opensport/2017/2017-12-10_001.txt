I'm a newbie creating a web app for a class project and I'm a bit crunched 
for time, so I was wondering if there is a download available for a 
currently up-to-date (or nearly, honestly it doesn't have to include 
everything, my professor won't care) football.db. If not, could someone 
make a short to-do list of how I would go about building the db required 
just to have simple stats on the top 5 leagues and all the players in them? 
I'm sorta having trouble parsing exactly what I'd need to do in order to 
make this happen. Thanks in advance.
