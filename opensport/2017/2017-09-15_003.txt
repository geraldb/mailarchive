I am stuck and cannot understand how to build the databases - I am using 
Pascal in Delphi for my A Level project and would like to use these 
databases.

I tried running "$ sportdb new en2015-16" in Command Prompt and it nothing 
happened.

This seems like a really good source and I would like to use this for my 
project.

Any help will be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

George
