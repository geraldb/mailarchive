According to the .txt of the site : http://openfootball.github.io/
It seems football.db should provide goals and persons (players) data 
because minutes and name of players are displayed.
Actually, commands 'select * from goals' and 'select * from players' return 
nothing.
Where the example in the website come from if not football.db then ? Am I 
missing something ?

Thanks for your answer !
