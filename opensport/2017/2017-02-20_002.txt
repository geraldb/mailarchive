Hi Gerald,

Thanks, I've updated the documentation.

The "right" way to do this is really to make a reusable Django app that 
users can just install and configure (e.g. pip install 
django-openfootball). However, since there's no evidence that anyone else 
wants to use this, I think I'll hold off for now. :-) I'll leave it as a 
Gist for the time being, but if there's sufficient interest I'll make it a 
proper app and host it at a sportlabs repository.

Cheers,
Kevin
