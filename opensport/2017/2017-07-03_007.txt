Hi, Firstly I tried to post this about 15 minutes ago on my mobile but I can't find the post anywhere, so I'm assuming it didn't go through. If it did, please disregard one. Secondly, apologies for creating an issue in github, I totally missed the link here.

Anyway. I've been working on a project that pulls results from the 2016/17 season of the role, and I was hoping to do the same with the 17/18 season. However, the database hasn't been updated since matchweek 7. I think the process is automated so is there a way to go about getting the information updated, and ensuring that come the start of next season, the info will be up to date?

Thanks,
Josh
