Hi Gerald,

Thanks for your great work on this project.

I recently wrote an adapter so that the football.db SQLite database can be 
accessed using the ORM in the Django web framework [1].

For example, here's a query that tells you how many home games Leicester 
City won by two goals or more in the EPL last season:

>>> Game.objects.filter(
    round__event__league__key="en",
    round__event__season__key="2015/16",
    team1__key="leicester",
    score1__gte=F("score2") + 2,
).count()

5

I'm happy to share it with others. I can just put it up as a Gist (it's a 
single file), but if you want to put it in one of your many repositories 
that would be fine too.

Cheers,
Kevin
