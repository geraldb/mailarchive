Subject: sportdb/console - Try sport.db w/ Interactive Ruby Console
From: Gerald Bauer <gerald.bauer@gmail.com>
To: "Open Sports Database (sport.db) and Friends" <opensport@googlegroups.com>

Hello,

   I've added support for the interactive Ruby console (irb) to the
open sports database gem. Use irb -r sportdb/console and you're ready
to go.  Try

  en = Country.find_by_key! 'en'; en.teams.all

or

   mun = Team.find_by_key! 'manunited'; mun.games.all

  and so on.

  Cheers.

PS: By the way the sportdb/console also works for the world.db because
all world tables and data is included.
