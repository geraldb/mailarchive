Ah that's brilliant man, that did the trick.  I really appreciate your help 
and prompt responses with this.  I really wanted to get this set up over 
the weekend and was afraid I wouldn't get it done in time.  I'm now able to 
get the json objects from my other site.  Really really thankful.  I'll be 
following the project.
