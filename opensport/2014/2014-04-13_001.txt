Hi there!

I've been looking into using sportdb for creating a non-commercial app for 
the world cup. When trying to use it with Rails 4 I've encountered number 
of issues regarding multiline anchors in regular expressions in sportdb and 
some of the dependencies (worlddb and tagutils). Is there a plan to upgrade 
these libraries to support rails 4 in the near future? 

Also, I fixed these errors locally to see if it still worked, and I keep 
getting file parsing erros when running 'sportdb setup'  when attempting to 
read a file which is not located within a gem:

*"[info] parsing data 'setups/all' 
(/home/thor/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.1.0/gems/sportdb-1.8.12/data/setups/all.txt)...*
*[info] parsing data 'seasons' 
(/home/thor/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.1.0/gems/sportdb-1.8.12/data/seasons.txt)...*
*[info] parsing data 'setups/all' (/setups/all.txt)...*
**** error: No such file or directory @ rb_sysopen - /setups/all.txt"*

Similarly when I run 'sportdb --dbname world-cup-2014.db setup --include 
./world-cup --worldinclude ./world.db' I get in the end:

*"[info] parsing data 'setups/all' 
(/home/thor/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.1.0/gems/sportdb-1.8.12/data/setups/all.txt)...*
*[info] parsing data 'seasons' 
(/home/thor/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.1.0/gems/sportdb-1.8.12/data/seasons.txt)...*
*[info] parsing data 'setups/all' (./world.db/setups/all.txt)...*
**** error: No such file or directory @ rb_sysopen - 
./world.db/setups/all.txt"*

Otherwise the models seem to work fine in the sportdb/console, I just don't 
have any data because of these missing file errors.

Cheers,
Thor
