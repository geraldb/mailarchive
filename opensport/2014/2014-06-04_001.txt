Hello,

   Thanks for your interest in football.db.   What (programming) language 
are you trying to use? 

   To host your own HTTP JSON API service, see the sport.db.api.starter kit 
[1].
   The basic API is documented in the api repo [2].
   If you're using JavaScript, see the football.js example [3].

  That's all what's available for now. You're welcome to post your 
questions as you go along (no guarentee for an answer - maybe someelse can 
help out or assist).  Good luck. Cheers.
