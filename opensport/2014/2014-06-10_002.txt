Hey Gerald, 

I am super interested in the soccer database, as I am leaning SQLite, but I 
am a java guy and not a ruby guy.

Is there any way you can pre-build the worldcup2014.db or the football.db 
with the updated players and rosters?

I did download the project, and I have all the text/data files separately, 
but I wouldn't know how to use ruby to load that data in.

I have OpenSuse 12.3 Linux, but I have never done ruby, so any other linux 
commands or ruby linux commands to import data would also help.

Thanks!
