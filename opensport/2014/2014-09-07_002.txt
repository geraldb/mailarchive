Hello,

   Sure. Go ahead. As always best to try out what works for you. Do
NOT wait - change to your needs.

   The idea of "my" format was and is to make it easy to read (w/ your
eyes not necessarly w/ a  Ruby one-liner ;-) ) - it definitely is a
very early draft (an expiriment)  -    the idea of adding more fields
into a single column again is making it easier to read (with your eyes
not w/ Ruby).   I know it's some extra efforts to use these "tiny"
microformats inside a column - but in the long run - sure it might
take a couple of hours or even days to code in Ruby - but you will
gain (save more time) in easier to manage source files.   Again the
philosophy is make it work like a wiki - that is - make it easy to
hand-craft and hand-edit source files.

   Again please feel free to change as needed and try out what works.
Keep it up. Cheers.

PS: For "plain" vanilla CSV formats there's always the football.csv
repo - here the philosophy is "machine" generated simple CSV files.
Thus, if you do NOT like the approach of microformats in columns,
please use "plain" vanilla CSV - always good to have choice and a
welcome addition to football.csv (and football.db).
