Hi Gerald:

Here Orlando, from Spain. I'm developing a mobile application to follow the 
WorldCup.  First I want to thank you for this iniciative. 

I use some of your sharings, mainly the json files from GitHub. I needed to 
append some metadata, like the local time (including UTC+3/+4), stadium, 
group and slot (a special indicator for embed the crossings of next stage) 
of the games.

Is there any way to get the results live? Maybe I could help somehow with 
this or another thing, because anyway I need add same data to reach my 
purpose.

Best regards, 
Orlando
