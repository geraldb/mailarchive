Hi,
I work for a daily newspaper in Switzerland and we are planning on building 
some kind of a match simulation app. 

For this, the only data I need are contained in 
https://github.com/openfootball/world-cup/blob/master/2014--brazil/cup.txt 
and 
https://github.com/openfootball/world-cup/blob/master/2014--brazil/cup_finals.txt 
as it allows to reference the winners of previous matches. I don't need 
actual results or anything. 

Now, I don't know how to parse this DSL, or do not have the time to write a 
parser. The only thing I would need is a list of all matches containing 
this info, e.g., as a CSV or JSON, so that I can parse it with JS. 

I downloaded the worldcup2014.db SQLite release but didn't anything similar 
in there. 

So is the same data available in another format? Or how do I compile a CSV 
or a JSON from it? 

Thanks!
