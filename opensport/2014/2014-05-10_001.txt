Sorry for the confusion. The documentation (only) for the API is hosted at 
the github.com/openfootball/api repo.

A public api endpoint/service runs at 
http://footballdb.herokuapp.com/api/v1 - since this runs on the Heroku free 
plan it is fairly limited e.g. only 10,000 records max. thus it only 
include a couple of events ( see footballdb.herokuapp.com/events )

Thus, it's always an option to self-host your own api service (locally) and 
you're also welcome to provide a public endpoint with the leagues / 
tournaments that are of interest to you, for example, also to the world. 
Cheers.
