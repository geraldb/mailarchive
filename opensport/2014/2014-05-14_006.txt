Hello C=C3=A9dric,

Thanks for you interest in football.db. Thanks for the reminder. Yes a new=
=20
service for squads (lineups) is definitely missing and planed to get added=
=20
(it will just be a couple of lines of Ruby) [1]

No worries the Ruby part is the easy part. The Wikipedia entry on the World=
=20
Cup 2014 squads [2] says:

> The 32 national teams involved in the tournament will be required to=20
register a squad of 23 players; only players in these=20
> squads will be eligible to take part in the tournament.=20
> A provisional list of 30 players per national team will be submitted to=
=20
FIFA by 13 May 2014. FIFA will publish the

=20
players per national team will be submitted to FIFA
> by 2 June 2014, FIFA will publish the final lists of 23 players on their=
=20
website on 5 June 2014.=20

  So the plan is to add the official squads / team players to the database=
=20
as soon as the get published. You're welcome to help out (no Ruby required;=
=20
just plain text [3]).  Cheers.
