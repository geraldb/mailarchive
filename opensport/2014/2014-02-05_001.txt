  The good news it's planned to add a location via stadiums (see [1]
). All stadiums for the world cup in Brazil are already included.  The
bad news it will realistically take a couple of weeks until I get
around adding the missing code.  Of course, you're more than welcome
to start adding the missing parts yourself. Thanks for your patience.

  Cheers.
