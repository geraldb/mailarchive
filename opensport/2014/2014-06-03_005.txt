Hello,
   Thanks for the update. Good to know its working.

   You can update all results and the fixtures using a rake task:

$ rake update

And that's the source:

desc 'sportbook: auto-update fixtures'
task :update => [:environment] do |t|
  SportDb.update!
end

  Good point. For now everybody has access if you know the admin link.
The admin login required functionality needs to get added. Cheers.
