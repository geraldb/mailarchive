Hi,

Thank you for providing such  great data. However, I dont mean to sound 
like such a newbie but I am really confused. I newly joined github and I 
have worked with various JSON apis in the past but this one seems to 
confuse me alot. What is the exact url to use the api. like 
 https://github.com/openfootball/api/event/world.2014/teams to get list of 
teams. or do I host them on my own server and how. Thanks Gerald
