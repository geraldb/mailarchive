What a great project thank you very much guys. I am very happy for found it.

I'm developing sport site on django. So I want to use football.db's table 
schema and data (trying to create django models using sqlite table schema).

Is there any schema explanation blog article or something else? There some 
fields that I can't guess purpose. For example: event.team3, 
countries.s/c/d etc...


PS: Sorry for my English, I hope you understand what I mean.

Thanks in advance.
