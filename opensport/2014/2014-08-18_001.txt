Subject: sportkit - sport.db.starter Update - Build Your Own HTTP JSON API
 (Ruby Edition)

Hello,

  FYI: I've updated the sport.db.starter kit (Ruby Edition) [1]. What's new?

  I've cleaned up the code - the idea is to make it easier to get
started and change as needed, for example:

  To start the sample web service there's no longer a rackup config.ru
(might confuse newbies - what's rack anyway?) - now just use:

  $ ruby server.rb

  I moved the database configuration into config/database.yml e.g.

 development:
    adapter: sqlite3
    database: football.db

  Again the idea is making it easier to use.

  Last but not least I added two new sample services, that is, / and /events.

  The /events service lists all events in your database you can use
for /events/:key/teams|rounds and so on.

  The / (index) service lists all endpoints (services) e.g.

{
  "endpoints": {
    "list_events": {
      "doc": "list all events",
      "url": "/events"
    },
    "list_event_teams": {
      "doc": "list teams for an event",
      "url": "/event/:key/teams"
    },
    "list_event_rounds": {
      "doc": "list rounds for an event",
      "url": "/event/:key/rounds"
    },
    "list_event_games_for_round": {
      "doc": "list games for an event round",
      "url": "/event/:key/round/:pos"
    }
  }
}

  The idea is kind of little builtin self-docu.  That's it. Enjoy. Cheers.
