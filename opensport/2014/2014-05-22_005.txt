Hello,

  Thanks for your interest in football.db. 

  > I downloaded the worldcup2014.db SQLite release but didn't anything 
similar in there. 

   Can you be more specific what's missing in the database?  The matchday 
number? The stadiums? The bracket rules (e.g. winner group a vs runner-up 
groub b) etc.

   Cheers.

   Try 

   $ sqlite3 worldcup2014.db
   >  select * from games;
   etc.  to query the db etc.

   Using free tools such as SQLite Studio you can always export all tables 
to csv or sql, for example.
