I would really like to build the champions league data. I already tried to 
fix the Champions League repo myself, but I get one error after another. It 
is very frustrating because all I get is ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound. This 
is obviously not very descriptive. Is there anyway to output more 
information about what it is trying to do?
