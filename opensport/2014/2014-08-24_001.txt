Hello,

  Thanks for trying fooball.db.

   Sorry the champions league build is currently not working - the plan is 
to get it working for the group phase ;-) starting in mid-September.   I 
try to get the build and setups updated this week (but as always - no 
guarantee - if you need anything as soon as possible, please try to update 
it yourself).

   Cheers.

PS: If you want to try out the build the English Premier League, French 
Ligue 1, Deutsche Bundesliga n Austrian Bundesliga is working and 
up-to-date.  e.g. try $ rake build DATA=de   and so on.
