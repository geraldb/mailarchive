Hello,

  FYI: Andrew Gallant (aka BurntSushi) has a couple of open source
projects (scripted in Python) that lets you build up NFL database from
the NFL Game Center JSON data service and that lets you rank players
on game stats and much more.

  The projects include:

   - github.com/BurntSushi/nflgame
   - github.com/BurntSushi/nfldb
   - github.com/BurntSushi/nflcmd

   Know any other open sport data projects? Let us know.

   Cheers.
