Hi all,
Gerald, many thanks for football.db in particular and for open source 
initiatives in general!!!
I'm looking for a full log of all UEFA champions league knock out phase 
matches since 1956, for a my statistic research, and can't find it in a 
reasonable format.
Perhaps someone can direct to a full CL database?
Thx,
Yotam
