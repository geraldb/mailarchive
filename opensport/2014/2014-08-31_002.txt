Hi Gerald,

I took a bit of a break, but I'm just now getting back into the swing of 
things.  I haven't forgotten about the stats - will look into that soon - 
but I wanted to deploy my sample app on Heroku.  I was just wondering - how 
do you initialize the db for the web admin you have running on heroku?  

Everything is pretty simple with an sqlite3 databse, but heroku only 
supports Postgresql, so I'm trying to create a build script or Rake task to 
load various setups, but I don't know if I can install the different 
repositories (i.e. world.db, openfootball/major-league-soccer) on the 
heroku app, so I might not be able to give a local path to the data.  Is 
there a way to install from a Git URL?  Any other suggestions.

BTW, I looked at your talk on WebComponents - very interesting!

Thanks!
Carl
