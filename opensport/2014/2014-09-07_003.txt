Hello Gerald,

I was looking at the stats format in football.db.ruby, and it seems kind of 
difficult to parse:

Name, Pos, Starts +SubIns, Saves [GK], GoalsConceded [GK], TotalGoals, 
TotalShots (ShotsOnTarget), GoalAssists, FoulsCommitted-FoulsSuffered, 
YellowCards/RedCards, Wins-Losses-Draws
Sean Johnson,    GK,  19 +0, 53, 33, -,      -,  -,  0-2,  0y/0r, 0-0-0
Greg Cochrane,   DF,  11 +0,  -,  -, 0,  4 (1),  2,  6-2,  2y/0r, -
Quincy Amarikwa, FW,  15 +2,  -,  -, 6, 37 (15), 3, 33-45, 4y/1r, -

If we are going the CSV route, why not give each stat its own column, and 
keep the heading names closer to the field names?  I think stats lend 
themselves to a stricter data format better than a schedule of games - what 
do you think?
