Hey I really appreciate the effort put into this and think it's awesome 
what you're doing.

I'm having a little trouble though.  Ultimately my goal is to get your data 
and then set up my own api that I can call.  The only data that I am 
interested in is world cup 2014 data.  Now, as I understand it, I should 
clone your sport.db.api.starter project.  From there, I'm having a little 
trouble getting the data that I need in there.  I believe that I need to 
get the right football.db created.  can i navigate to my local 
sport.db.api.starter project and execute a sportdb command to get world cup 
data directly?  typically when i try to do that it seems I am missing some 
dependency.  Could you help a dense noob out?

Thanks a lot.
