  To track / watch all 64 world cup matches and enter all data in less
than five minutes might be a challenge.

   The football.db- uses plain text files -  that get imported into
your database of choice - as it's source.   Thus, one way (the
"official" way) might be:
  - Change  world-cup/2014/cup.txt and save/commit
  - Git web hook pings your web app (online db w/ built-in json service)
  - web app fetches (via HTTP GET) updated cup.txt and reads/imports into d=
b
  - web app pushes changes to registers apps
  - and so on.

  I'd say the challenge will be getting the data entered on time.
Might also be easier / more manageable to enter the data into the db
directly (not via git). Sorry I have no magic formula. Your're welcome
to try what works for you.    Cheers.
