First of all - thank you for such useful and well-written tools!  I was 
wondering if you know of any open data for US Major League Soccer (MLS).  I 
saw some data for the teams in football.db/national-teams, but I didn't see 
anything for players or matches.  Do you have any pointers?

Many Thanks,
Carl
