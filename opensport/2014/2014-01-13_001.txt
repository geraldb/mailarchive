Hello,

First of all, thank you for providing all those great DB, API and apps !

For example, I though I could help you to:

   - translate your openbookie app in french,
   - add some football championship fixtures (Ligue 1, La Liga, Serie 
   A,...),
   - another idea you'll want to improve?

BUT I'm really a newbie so I don't know really where to start! What would 
you advice me: to learn the Ruby on Rails, to install openbookie on my own 
heroku platform (so what?), to read some tutorials (which one?),...

Thanks a lot,

Alexandre
