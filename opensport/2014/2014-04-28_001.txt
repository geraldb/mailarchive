Hello,

  If you happen to be around in Central Europe (in Austria) you're
invited to meet-up.

  On Wednesday, April 30th  I will be at the Vienna.js meetup [1] at
Sektor 5 in Vienna, Austria w/ a short talk titled

  - Using Open Football Data - Get Ready for the World Cup in Brazil
w/ JavaScript

  On Sunday, May 10th I will be at the Linuxwochen Wien 2014 [2] at
the FH Technikum in Vienna, Austria w/ two short talks:

  - Open Football - The State of Open Data for the World Cup in Brazil

  The world's biggest (sport) event happens in a couple of weeks in
Brazil. What's the state of open data for the World Cup? And football
in general? What open data offers the FIFA? What other sources are
available? Join to learn more and discuss the state of open data.

  - Use Markdown for Website, Presentations and Books

  Use Markdown - a wiki-style markup language that=E2=80=99s easy-to-write =
and
easy-to-read - to author and build web site, presentations (slide
shows) and books. Learn about Markdown syntax, formatting and tools
for websites (incl. blogs), presentations and books. Examples will
include websites such as the Open Football Project and books such as
the The Free World Football Almanac.

   Everyone welcome. All events free. Join us. Cheers.
