Hi Gerald,

Thanks for the suggestions.  I finally took a look at your updates to 
football.db.stats - looks nice and contained :).  I see the tests are a 
good example of how to use the readers directly.  It looks like the 
plumbing is all there, but it still needs the logic to create the stat 
records in the database.  I can start working on this if you haven't done 
so already.

One question: What do you plan for the usage of this plugin?  I was 
originally thinking of a solution that could reuse the sportdb 
command-line, and additionally parse stats.  This seems to be going in the 
direction of using build scripts to piece together the information.  I 
think either approach is fine, but do you have some examples of how to 
translate, say the following command, into calls to sportdb modules?

sportdb_ss -n mls_stats.db setup all --include ../major-league-soccer/ 
--worldinclude ../../openmundi/world.db/

Thanks!
Carl
