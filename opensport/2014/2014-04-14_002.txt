Subject: Re: [opensport] Rails 4 support and setup errors

Hello,

   Thanks for trying the sportdb gem.

>  Is there a plan to upgrade these libraries to support rails 4 in the near future?

   Yes, of course. Will try to fix all regex anchors in the next
weeks. Thanks for your patience.

> Also, I fixed these errors locally to see if it still worked, and I keep getting file parsing erros when

   If you know Rails / Ruby  I recommend using a build script
(Rakefile). Otherwise please try the --verbose flag and post the stack
trace.

  Note, if you use sportdb setup you always need use the --include
option to point to your fixtures - the fixtures are NOT included in
the gem. You have to clone - get copies from GitHub ( see
github.com/openfootball ).   Let me know if it works or what errors
you get or what questions you have.

  Cheers.
