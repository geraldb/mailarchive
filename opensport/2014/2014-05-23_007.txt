I'm new to this type of open community and don't understand how to extract 
the data from the open database.  Please have some patience, I hope this 
isn't a dumb question.

I saw in the description that the schema has 10 or so tables in all.  Is it 
possible to export the data in a raw form (csv, txt, excel) for each table? 
 I have some data mining ideas I'm working on and having the data from each 
table would be very helpful.

Thanks for your time and help in advanced.  I'm sorry I'm such a novice.

Respectfully,

Joel K.
