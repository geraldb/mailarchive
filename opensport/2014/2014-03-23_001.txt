Hi!

I recent discover football.db and its great! and i really want to learn how 
to use it, but i don't know how to start, so here are my questions:

1- I see from your page that i had to set the database for the information, 
is any othe way to access the data no locally? I see that this<https://github.com/geraldb/football.js>is a way, is the only way?

2- I use football.js but when a have to access i get a 500 Internal Server 
Error... so, is any other place for the data?

3- How update the data in real time?

Great solution!

Cheers!
