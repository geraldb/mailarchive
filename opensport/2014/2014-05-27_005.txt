how can i get them through the API? is that

  The API is document here -> github.com/openfootball/api  or  use the 
source -> github.com/geraldb/sport.db.api.starter

   I'd recommed updating with the build script (e.g. rake update 
DATA=worldcup), for example Use what works for you. Good luck. Cheers.
