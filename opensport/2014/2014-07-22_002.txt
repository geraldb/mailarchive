Thanks for the pointers. I'll take a crack at turning it into a plugin
first, and then probably ask you for help when I get stuck :-)

I originally wanted something generic like sport.db.stats so I could reuse
some of this for hockey, too. If the player models are going to be specific
to a sport, do you have any suggestions for how to share the stats and
squad parsing code? Maybe some of it could be patched into the mainline,
and the sport specific items can be factored out into different plugins.
Perhaps the generic stats, squad parsing, and a simple PlayerStat model go
into the mainline, and the details go into football.sport.db. How does that
sound?

Thanks for letting me contribute to the project! I really like the tools
you've built.
