Hi Gerald,

I just installed the sport.db.ruby<https://github.com/geraldb/sport.db.ruby>and fired up the server - works very well!

I noticed that the sqlite database contains both the time and date of a 
fixture but the JSON service only displays the date. Also, the group is not 
shown in the case of a world cup, for example. How can I change this? 

Admittedly, I installed via 'gem install sportdb' - but I have looked into 
the source. Looks like it is something 
in: https://github.com/geraldb/sport.db.ruby/blob/master/lib/sportdb/models/game.rb
Could you please give me a hint?

Thanks,
Fabio
