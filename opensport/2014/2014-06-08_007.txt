Np, the documentation has been really good and thanks again.  I created a 
DB dump locally and then loaded that into heroku using pg:push into the 
proper database.  when i browse my postgres databases on heroku, i can see 
that the tables and data did get all up there, but I seem to have some 
other issue.  I can't quite put my thumb on where the issue arises.  I 
believe that I need to edit my config.ru file slightly or some other 
configuration.  I'm getting

"Could not connect to server: No such file or directory.  Is the server 
running locally and accepting connections on Unix domain socket 
"/var/run/postgresql/.s.PGSQL.5433"
