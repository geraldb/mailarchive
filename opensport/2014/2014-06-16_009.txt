I'm trying to make a visualization that is dependent on knowing the order 
the games were played in and I'm just wondering where the POS data came 
from? As far as I can tell, the 3rd and 4th games are out of order unless 
I'm misunderstanding how it works. I tried to order the games by play_at 
date using the query "Event.last.games.order('play_at')", but my query 
contains "ORDER BY pos, play_at". Any ideas on whether the data is wrong or 
why the 'sportdb/console' automatically orders by 'pos'?
