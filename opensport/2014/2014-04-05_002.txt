Hello,
  Thanks for trying. Can you expand on the warning you get about the
regex (what file? what regex? what module? etc.) What version of
ActiveRecord are you using? Do you have more info about why this is a
security risk?

  Sorry, so far I didn't get this warning. Thanks for raising the issue.

   Cheers.
