Hi all,

First of all I would like to say a big THANKS to Gerald for all the help 
provided to achieve the data and all the support he gave to me, THANK YOU!

I would like also to introduce Bitkup, an app developed to bet during the 
Brazil FIFA's World Cup with Bitcoins. You can also play without betting 
any Bitcoins, just for fun!

https://bitkup.com/en

(Gerald, you won an account with 0.05 Bitcoins for playing! Write me at 
oriol[at]bitkup[dot]com to arrenge that.)

Cheers
