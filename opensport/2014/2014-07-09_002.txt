Sounds good.  I've added "Week N" before each week's worth of match data 
for each year, and I moved the qualifying and playoff rounds to comments 
for now.  

I think the rounds that are already defined will work for MLS data.  I had 
to do some research to understand the playoff format.  Ten teams go into 
the playoffs, 5 from each division (east/west), and the first round is a 
match between 4th and 5th place in each division.  Winners move on to the 
Semi Final round, and the Final round follows that.  I think that format 
can fit into the existing rounds... I think it would be fun to write an app 
that runs different scenarios for those final rounds, since there is some 
calculating involved in figuring out the winners.

Anyways, thanks for your help!
