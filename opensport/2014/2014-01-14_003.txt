Hello, great work here you've done! Thanks for making it an oss. I'm 
currently building a blog for the local league in my country and I'm 
totally out of my depths on how to write the fixtures and results portion 
of the app. I am using Rails 4 and I'd really appreciate a push in the 
right direction in this regard.

If you require more details about the app, in relation to how you might be 
able to help me, I'd be glad to oblige.
