Hi there!

First of all, thank you guys for your work! :)

I have a couple of questions:

1 - As another user asked before, how are the data maintained? I mean, when 
are you gonna update a result after the match is played? (An example)

2 - Which data is included for a result? (Who scored the goals?)

3 - I don't know where can I find all the possible available URLs for the 
web service.

Thanks again guys! Awesome work!

Oriol.
