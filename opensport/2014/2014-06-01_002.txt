Hello Arne,

  Thanks for your interest in football.db and thanks for sharing.

   You're invited to add the missing Bundesliga seasons. The football.db 
project uses plain text files - you're files are pretty close.   You can 
see an example here [1].  Let me know if you're interested in adding 
missing seasons (files need to get split per season) and I can assist you 
to get started.   Cheers.
