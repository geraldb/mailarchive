Hello Orlando,

   Thanks for your interest in football.db.  Any help appreciated. Maybe 
you can share an example of your JSON file - this will help adding what's 
missing (e.g. stadium, group, etc.) You know it better ;-)

> Is there any way to get the results live? 

    Depends on how often the results gets updated.  If there's any interest 
- one way is to work out a schedule for entering updates.

   What is your definition of live?  An update every minute? Is that good 
enough? Every five minutes? Every ten seconds?

   Cheers.
