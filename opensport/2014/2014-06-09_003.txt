Hello,
I'm trying to set up my own little server, to update scores and not waste 
your bandwidth :) but am struggling with getting rails working with sportdb.

I have the basic rails server running. Without sounding too helpless, what 
are the next steps:

gem install sportdb?

copy the world cup db into the app directory?
