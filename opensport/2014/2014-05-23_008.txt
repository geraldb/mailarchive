This is probably a dumb question but I am new to this and would ask for=20
some understanding...

Is there a way to get just the data?  Like a csv, txt, or excel sheet for=
=20
each table in the database?  I would like to have the raw data to work on=
=20
some data mining ideas.

Thanks and I'm sorry for this type of question.

Joel K.
