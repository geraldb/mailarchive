Hi,

First of all I'd like to say thank you for providing such a useful service.

My current concern is about the HTTP JSON API. I'd like to develop a sample=
=20
pronostics games based on it.
I don't see any option to get the players in a team, for example something=
=20
like /event/world.2014/team/esp

Do you have any plans for it yet ? I'm not on github but i'm willing to=20
contribute. I've never used Ruby before though.

Best regards,
C=C3=A9dric
