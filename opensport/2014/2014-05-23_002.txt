Hello All,

Thanks for the wonderful work that you do. I just downloaded and built my 
own football.db database. However, I find that for the world-cup, while I 
have team scores, there is no information on who scored the goals, the 
times they were scored at, etc. Can you please tell me if it is possible to 
get that information?

Thanks,
Arun
