Hello Mante Bridts,

  Thanks for your interest in football.db.

> Can you tell me if the scores will be updated (in the API) and in what 
interval (once a day? every minute?).

   Sorry for any false expectations. There will be NO real-time update. 
It's an all volunteer effort. If you want a guarantee, you have to update 
the results yourself.   I try to update the world cup results once a day 
but really no guarantee for nothing.

> Also, will there be any limit on the number of calls to the API?

   Again the best way is to host your own API service (and change it to 
your needs). Use the sportdb command line tool or try the 
sport.db.api.starter script, for example.     

   Good luck for Belgium in the World Cup!  Cheers.
