Hi,

im doing my first experiments with football.db. i plan to write a little 
flask-based app to bet with my family on the world cup games. 

 - in the example (http://footballdb.herokuapp.com/) are the kickoff-times. 
also in cup.txt 
(https://github.com/openfootball/world-cup/blob/master/2014--brazil/cup.txt). 
how can i get them through the API? is that possible?

- i want to host the api by myself. so i build the DB and started it with 
"sportdb -n football.db serve". whats the best way to update the db? 
writing a script to pull the new data from the repos and building them? or 
is something like this implemented in the sportdb command?

thank you for the awesome work on this. i love opendata... and even more if 
they are about football ;-)
