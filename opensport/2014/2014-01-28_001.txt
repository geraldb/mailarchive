Hi all,

I'm new to this forum, I have come across football.db while doing search on 
Google.

I have a few questions below;

1) Is the wold cup information currently up to date? (How is it maintained 
when the cup starts)
2) Is it possible to make a iOS application that will take date from your 
site and display to the user.
3) Is there any applications on the web / mobile that make use of the open 
source sports db, to view a example.

Any tips and pointers would be great

Thank you
Regards,
Max
