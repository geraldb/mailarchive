Hello Nico,

   Thanks for reporting the bug w/ activerecord. 

   It looks like an issue with the latest ActiveRecord gem version, that 
is, 4.1.1.  Maybe it no longer supports :order  - that might be strange 
news - will check the gem shortly - in the meantime you can always use an 
older activerecord version eg. 4.0.0.

  What match schedule / fixture are you trying to read?   Austria? World 
Cup?  

  Cheers.
