Hey guys

I was wondering if the football.db JSON API would offer some kind of real 
time updates for results of games, or a hook to get the info. Or if not if 
we were restricted to do a GET request every 5 mns or so for instance.

What are your thoughts? Maybe you can point me in the right direction here 
but we want to build a super simple plugin in our product so our teams can 
have the game results live from within the product

Thanks

Maxime
