Hello Thompson Edolo,

   Thanks for your kind words. To get started with writing your fixtures 
and match results (and teams) I suggest creating a new github repo as a 
first step. Than add a teams.txt file listing all your teams.  Let me know 
how it goes. Post a link to your repo if you have questions and I can see 
if I can help out. Keep going.. Cheers.
