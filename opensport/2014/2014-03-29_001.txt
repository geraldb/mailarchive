Hello Yotam,

  Maybe you can find something at the RSSSF (Rec.Sport.Soccer
Statistics Foundation) archive [1]. I've started on an importer/reader
for the Brazil RSSSF fixtures last year as an example how this might
work [2].

   The best source as always will likely be the Wikipedia. See the
1955-56 European Cup page [3] as an example. You might start your own
git repo and use the Wikipedia data (cut-n-paste, for example) and
than cleanup the format for import w/ the sportdb command line tool
for your SQL database of choice.  You can see an example for playoff
fixtures [4] in the open football repo. Good luck.

   You might also post your question on Stackexchange [5] or Reedit
[6], for example.

  Cheers.
