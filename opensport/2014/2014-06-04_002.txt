Hello,

I am looking into creating a 2014 World Cup application which will display: 
fixtures, teams and players. 

I have looked into:

http://okfnlabs.org/blog/2014/05/06/open-data-world-cup.html
https://github.com/openfootball/world-cup/tree/master/2014--brazil

However, I have no idea where to start really; I have downloaded the 
database but as my application is going to be for BlackBerry 10 mobile 
devices: I need to access the data in JSON rather than a database. So, my 
question is: how do I use either the database to display fixtures, teams 
and players in JSON format or how can I use the txt files to display the 
data? 

Thanks in advance. 

Kind regards, 

Toby Clench
