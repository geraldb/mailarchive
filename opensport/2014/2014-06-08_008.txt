Hello,

  It's a rack web application. That's the easy part. See the Heroku 
DevCenter Article title "Deploying Rack-based Apps" [1] 

>  Did you perhaps have that documented somewhere?  It seems that in 
sqlite3 I can point directly to the .db file

have on that.

  That's the "hard" part. You have to create the database tables via $ 
heroku run rake db:create or similar on the remote heroku host (server)  
and than again on the remote heroku host (server) load the data into the 
database with your own rake task.  You can include the datasets in your 
Gemfile (see sport.db.admin as an example[2]).

   gem 'worlddb-data', '9.9.9', git: 
'https://github.com/openmundi/world.db.git'
   gem 'footballdb-data-world-cup', '9.9.9', git: 
'https://github.com/openfootball/world-cup.git'
   ...

  Sorry no easy answer and sorry there's no documentation so far. Cheers.
