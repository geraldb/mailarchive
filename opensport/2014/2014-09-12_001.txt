Hi, sorry if I'm new but I really can't understand how this works... 

I never programmed in Ruby but I'm looking for a Json or XML soccer results 
api, to use it in a mobile app. Can I do it with your project? 

I tried to read the getting started links, but they say I have to copy the 
whole SQLlite db to get the fresh results? Is that true? Can't I just 
request the json from your server?
