Thanks for all your help, I got the DB built!

Now I'm having trouble with the API. I'm using the starter kit (tried with 
both the Go and Node versions) and cannot get `/rounds` or `/games` to 
work. The `/teams` endpoint works fine.

Here's what I get:

$ curl http://localhost:9292/event/world.2014/rounds

{"error":{"status":404,"message":"Not Found"}}
