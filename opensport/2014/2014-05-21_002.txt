Subject: Project Spotlight - FootballData n OpenFootballApi and by Joe Kampschmidt

Hello,

  Just found a new football (soccer) data project on GitHub.

  Joe Kampschmidt from Washington, DC has put together football data
sets (using comma-separated values) mostly sourced from
football-data.co.uk  in the FootballData [1] repo on GitHub. The
readme reads:

  Football/Soccer data for anyone to use. The data is INCOMPLETE but
should serve as a good starting point for anyone interested. The data
includes most of the premier/first division leagues in the world. The
teams attributed to leagues will mostly adhere to the last year's
league tables.

  When using the data some cleanup will be required. Some teams might
show up twice in the team league. This will happen if the team was
recently in multiple leagues/cups.

 Data is in CSV format. Available Data/Schema:

    Leagues @ Leagues.csv
     -   Name (full name)
     -   Code (5-6 alphanumeric abbreviation)
    Teams @ Teams.csv
     -   Name (full team name)
     -   League (League Code) that team has recently been involved in
    ...

  Joe Kampschmidt has also put together an open source football
(soccer) data API using C# backed by an SQLite database in another
repo on GitHub titled OpenFootballApi [2].

  Know any other open football projects? Let us know. Cheers.
