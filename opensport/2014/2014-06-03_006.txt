Aah, that sorted it out!  I had deleted everything and restarted a couple 
of times but always with the rake db:setup deleting the db and using rake 
db:migrate then seed worked great.

Thank you very much for your efforts producing this and the help to get it 
working.

How will the knock-out stages work? are these added by the fixtures page in 
admin?

btw all of the users in the demo seem to have access to admin and can 
change anything seems to be the same on your herukoapp demo.
Is there a way to restrict normal users to only use the main app?

Grtz
