Hello,

  FYI: To keep track of alternative football (soccer) data projects I
started a new GitHub org [1]. Projects forked (listed) include:

  - llimllib/soccerdata   by Bill Mill (Portland, Maine - United States)

    The goal of this project is to be an up-to-date, open, easily
machine-processible repository of soccer results.

  - jokecamp/FootballData   by Joe Kampschmidt (Washington DC, United State=
s)

   Football/Soccer data for anyone to use. The data includes most of
the premier/first division leagues in the world. The teams attributed
to leagues will mostly adhere to the last year's league tables.

  - sanand0/fifadata   by S Anand (Bangalore, India)

   As part of the FIFA Design Hackathon we built this scraper to pull
every world cup's result from linguasport.com. This also includes who
scored each goal and when, along with which player was booked and
when.

  - orlandoaleman/FootballAppResources   by Orlando Alem=C3=A1n (Las Palmas=
, Spain)

   Takes a wikipedia page similar to
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Euro_2012_squads and generates as many
files as teams. Every file is a json containing coach and players of
the squad/team.


  If you know any other football data projects let us know. Cheers.
