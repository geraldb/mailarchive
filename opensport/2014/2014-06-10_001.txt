Hello,

   Thanks for you interest in football.db.  I'm just a regular guy not a 
coding or documentation machine.  Yes, I have an updated worldcup2014.db 
version planed - sorry no miracle - one step after the other. It's an open 
source project, that is, it's ready when it's ready. Sorry, I can't promise 
anything.

   To build your own version you can find build docu here [1] and here 
[2]   Not really a tutorial (step-by-step guide).  Just start and if you 
have questions as you go along post them here maybe someone can help you 
out. All the best. Good luck. Two days and counting to kick off! Cheers.
