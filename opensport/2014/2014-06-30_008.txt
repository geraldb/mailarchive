I forked major-league-soccer and made a few edits based on trial and error. 
 

https://github.com/cecomp64/major-league-soccer

   - Need a mls.yml config for games (creates an event and associates teams 
   with an event)
   - Need to have a date for each game... as listed, the dates didn't 
   parse, and I got the following error when trying to load via the sportsdb 
   command line tool: 

sportdb -n mls2.db load major-league-soccer/2014/mls
*** error: SQLite3::ConstraintException: games.play_at may not be NULL

   - So, I changed the format of the data to satisfy this constraint. 
    Example:

Matchday 1

Sat Mar/8 Seattle Sounders FC    1-0   Sporting Kansas City

I appreciate any feedback!  I'm still figuring out how these tools work, so 
I may likely be doing something wrong, but at least what I have checked in 
creates some valid data.

Thanks,
Carl
