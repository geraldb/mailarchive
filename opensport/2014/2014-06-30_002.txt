Subject: sportdb update (v1.9.3) - Now Includes Better Squads Reader
 (Auto-Creates Missing Players)
From: Gerald Bauer <gerald.bauer@gmail.com>

Hello,

  FYI: I've uploaded a new sportdb version, that is, v1.9.3   What's new?

   The sportdb reader for squads (rosters) will now auto-add missing
players. You can try it for example using the World Cup 1930 squads
e.g.

   $ rake update DATA=history     # loads/reads/parses all world cup
from 1930 to 2010

   Squads get added to the rosters join table (one record per player)
and missing players get auto-added to the persons table.

  All still a little rough. Still trying to figure out how to deal
with a circular reference e.g. schedules/fixtures include goals scored
by players (from squads) but the schedules get currently read before
the squads.

   That's it.

   Enjoy the France - Nigeria  and Germany - Algeria matches today!   Cheers.
