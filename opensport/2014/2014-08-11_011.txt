Thank you for your extensive response.

I saw models source code, actually it is very useful. But I still have some 
unknown fields. At MVP 1 level I'm only doing league standing (event & 
event standing) related things. So for now here is a list of fields that I 
can't guess:

   - league.club
   - city.popm (I guess population in million but data doesn't seem so)
   - region.nuts
   - country.net/motor/fifa
   - place.kind - What kind of choices do have totally? I can collect some 
   kind from models, but I can't make sure it's complete or not.


Thank you.
