Subject: sportdb Command Line Update - What's New? Read/Import Players and Squads/Rosters
From: Gerald Bauer <gerald.bauer@gmail.com>

Hello,

  FYI: I've updated the sportdb gem, that is, version 1.8.25. What's new?

  Still a little rough but you can now read in football players
(goalkeepers, defenders, midfielders, etc.). See the players repo [1]
that lists players by country.

  "Unassigned" players will get read (imported) into the persons
table. If you use the build script, try for example:

  $ rake update DATA=players

 That will read in all football players in the players repo.

 Next you can add players to teams (for squads/rosters). See the World
Cup 2014 team squads as an example (/2014--brazil/squads/*) [2].
"Assigned" players will get read (imported) into the rosters (soon to
be renamed squads) join table (event ref+team ref+player ref). Again
if you use the build script, try for example:

  $ rake update DATA=squads

  There's really no "magic" the build instructions read:

  SportDb.read_setup( 'setups/all',         PLAYERS_INCLUDE_PATH )
  SportDb.read_setup( 'setups/all',         NATIONAL_TEAMS_INCLUDE_PATH )
  SportDb.read_setup( 'setups/2014_squads', WORLD_CUP_INCLUDE_PATH )

   That's it. Again still a little rough so expect some surprises. Cheers.
