Cool, thanks for the reply.  I've got it up and running and added a few new 
REST requests to what you had already supplied in the starter api.  My next 
question is in trying to get this deployed to heroku.  Did you perhaps have 
that documented somewhere?  It seems that in sqlite3 I can point directly 
to the .db file but that doesn't fly in postgres.  Would appreciate any 
guidance you have on that.

Thanks again!
