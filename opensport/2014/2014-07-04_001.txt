Hello again, Gerald,

I have populated my copy of major-league-soccer with some more data, and 
had a few questions about the input format:

1) I wanted to make the rounds for each year something like "Qualifying" or 
"Regular Season", "Quarter Final", "Semifinal", and "Final", but I can't 
seem to get the format right.  This is the format I'm trying:

Qualifying

Sat Mar/2 08:00 Philadelphia Union           1-3 Sporting Kansas City
Sat Mar/2 10:45 Vancouver Whitecaps FC           1-0 Toronto FC
...

Quarter Final

Sat Nov/2 12:00 New England Revolution           2-1 Sporting Kansas City
Sat Nov/2 14:20 Seattle Sounders           1-2 Portland Timbers
...

Final

Sat Dec/7 08:20 Sporting Kansas City           1-1 Real Salt Lake


.. etc.  This doesn't seem to work for any of the years, except it 
partially works for the 2008 data.  As far as I can tell it's all the same 
format, so I'm not sure why the difference there.  Instead of the rounds 
I'm trying to specify, I get a default "Matchday N" round.  Do you know how 
I can correctly specify the rounds?

2) Perhaps related to #1, I get a number of warnings about no round match 
being found:

[warn]   !!!! no round match found for date 2014-03-15T08:00:00+00:00

Any ideas how to correct it?

Many thanks!
Carl
