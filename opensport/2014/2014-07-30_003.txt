A test case would be a great idea.  Here's a snippet and link to one of the 
squads:

https://github.com/openfootball/major-league-soccer/blob/master/test_data/2014/squads/chicago-2014.txt

(25) Sean Johnson
$$ pos: G, starts: 19, subIns: 0, saves: 53, goalsConceded: 33, foulsCommitted: 0, foulsSuffered: 2, yellowCards: 0, redCards: 0, wins: 0, losses: 0, draws: 0, 


(16) Greg Cochrane
$$ pos: D, starts: 11, subIns: 0, totalGoals: 0, totalShots: 4, shotsOnTarget: 1, goalAssists: 2, foulsCommitted: 6, foulsSuffered: 2, yellowCards: 2, redCards: 0, 


I am just noticing the extra comma at the end, but it didn't affect my 
parsing, as I just searched for the "$$" and then split the remainder of 
the string on commas.  A pretty simple format to make it easy to parse.  I 
believe all of these match fields that I created in the PlayerStat model, 
and if the parser encounters a field it does not know, it makes a generic 
stat entry.
