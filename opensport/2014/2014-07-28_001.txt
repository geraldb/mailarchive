Thanks for the feedback!  I think those are good suggestions, but I am a
bit concerned about data integrity - now the stats format will need a
consistent way to refer to a person, team, and event, whereas before those
were implied by the squad reader. It shouldn't be a problem for the scripts
that generate the stats, but might be hard to update manually. I'll take a
crack at it later this week.

It seems that either way, a plugin might need a hook into the case
statement in reader.rb to insert its functionality and have access to the
database. Reader.rb might want to check for plugin code before evaluating
built in code, because one problem I ran into with the squads was that the
team keys were more than 3 characters and it actually matched on some race
track parsing.

Maybe a hook into reader.rb and the create database functions would help
expand the plugin potentials.

Again, thanks for the support!

<br>
<br>

<br>
