Subject: New football.db Build System - Welcome Datafile - Goodbye Git 'n' Rake
From: Gerald Bauer <gerald.bauer@gmail.com>
To: opensport@googlegroups.com
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

Hello,

  FYI: I've uploaded a new sportdb command line tool version, that is,
v1.9.11. What's news?

  The sportdb command line tool includes a new build system (as a new
and easier all-in-one option).

  To try it - use the new Datafile - a mini language a.k.a.
domain-specific language (DSL) that lets you setup new football.db in
minutes.

  For example, to setup a football.db for the World Cup 2014 use:

Datafile:

   world 'openmundi/world.db', setup: 'countries'

   football 'openfootball/national-teams'
   football 'openfootball/world-cup', setup: '2014'



  That's it.  Now run

$ sportdb build

  The new build command will look for the ./Datafile script in your
working folder
and

 Step 1)  Download all datasets as zip archives (from GitHub) to  ./tmp
 Step 2)  Create all database tables
 Step 3)  Read/import all datasets from the zip archives in ./tmp (no
need to unpack)

   That's it.  Still early and rough. If you try the new Datafile
build let us know how it goes.

   Cheers.
