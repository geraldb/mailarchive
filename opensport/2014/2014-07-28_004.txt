Hi Gerald,

I experimented a bit with trying to create a plugin.  I moved all the code 
specific to player stats into football.db.stats, as you saw, but now I'm 
kind of stuck.  I see some code in sport.db.ruby to find and require a 
plugin file if it is released as a gem with a particular name, though the 
call to that function seems to be commented out.  Even with that call 
commented in, I'm not sure how to get the sportdb to update the schema 
based on what's defined in my plugin.  I saw that sport.db.market defined a 
new module and it's own create method, but I don't see the connection.

Do you have any advice?  Maybe you could take a look at it and comment on 
how to format the plugin properly.

Thanks!
Carl
