Hello,
  Again thanks for sharing the data and your scripts. Fantastic.

 FYI:  I added all the data (all seasons before 1993/94) to the
football.csv/en-england repo [1] and split up the huge all-in-one file
into a folder for each season and a file for each division. I also
added an auto-generated README in every season folder - that includes
standings (home,away, totals) auto-generated from the .csv files in
the folder. As an example, the 1955-56 seaons [2] looks like:

  /en-england/
    /1950s
      /1955-56
         1-division1.csv
         2-division2.csv
         3a-division3n.csv
         3b-division3s.csv
         README

  Again thanks for sharing. Keep it up. Cheers.

PS: The import script (e.g. rake engsoccer) [3] resides in the build repo.
