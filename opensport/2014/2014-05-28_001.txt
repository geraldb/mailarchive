Hi Orlando and Gerald,


First I would like to thank you for the great idea and work you have put=20
into this. Really nice to see!

I would like to build some kind of app/site to track the scores for the=20
upcoming World Cup. Can you tell me if the scores will be updated (in the=
=20
API) and in what interval (once a day? every minute?).
Also, will there be any limit on the number of calls to the API?

Very important to know... :)


Kind regards from Belgium!
