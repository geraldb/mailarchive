Hi,

I'm new to this community, but thought you might be interested in some 
data I've recently uploaded to github.  It started with me wanting to 
put together a fun dataset that I could use to teach R to students, but 
I thought others would be interested - hence this email.

By collecting data from multiple sources (listed in the readme), I have 
collated all English soccer results from all games ever played in the 
top 4 tiers from 1888-2014  (188,060 matches).  This includes the 1939 
truncated season, matches for teams that subsequently dropped out 
mid-way through a season (Wigan Borough, Leeds City, Accrington Stanley) 
and Port Vale who joined mid-way through a season (1919/20 replacing 
Leeds City).

Throughout, I have used team names as they are today (e.g. Newton Heath 
are listed as Manchester United, Ardwick as Manchester City).

Only games from 1992- onwards have dates of matches (thanks to geraldb 
's repo).   Prior to that I have not yet got match dates, but the Season 
is listed (e.g. 1952/3 season would be listed as 1952,  1892/3 as 1892).


I hope that people enjoy this dataset and that it is useful to some.

The link to my github repo is: https://github.com/jalapic/engsoccerdata


Thanks
James
