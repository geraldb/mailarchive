Hello,

   Good question. That's the big plus using structured data.

> how to add league standings? such as number of match played, 
win-draw-lose, goal scored, etc.

  League standings get auto-calculated using sql queries and updates! Big 
plus: Always up-to-date (just recalculate). 

  Of course, someone has to write some sql scripts. You're welcome to get 
started.

   Once the standings are stored in the database you can generate reports / 
booklets / web pages etc. as you like. 

   Cheers.
