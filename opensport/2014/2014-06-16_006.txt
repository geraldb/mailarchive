Hello,

I want to use the Data, but I want to add times. My Problem is, that the 
order of the games is wrong. 
So for example on Matchday 5 the first game is Germany against Portugal and 
not Iran against Nigeria.
Is there a possibility to bring the matches in the right order, or are 
somewhere data with the Time?

Sorry for my bad English, but I am German ;)

Thanks

Maike
