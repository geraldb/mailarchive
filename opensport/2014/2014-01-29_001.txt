Hello,

1 - As another user asked before, how are the data maintained? I mean, when 
> are you gonna update a result after the match is played? (An example)
>

    The match data is a plain text file residing on GitHub. For example, 
the match data for the World Cup 2014 in Brazil lives @ 
 github.com/openfootball/world-cup/blob/master/2014/cup.txt

   Basically, it works like a wiki - anybody can update it (if you're a 
openfootball team member - you can update it directly; otherwise you may 
use a pull request).   It's an all volunteer effort, thus, there is no 
guarantee for updates. In practice I plan to update the World Cup 2014 at 
least once a day (since I plan to use the results for sportbook).

   Once the results got updated on GitHub - you can sync your app via the 
built in machinery of the sportdb gem (basically just call SportDb.update! 
)  or use the public HTTP JSON API that gets for now updated once a day 
(that is, every 24 hours). 
 

>
> 2 - Which data is included for a result? (Who scored the goals?)
>

   For now only the results e.g.   Italy 3-0 Spain   etc.
. Again see the plain text fixtures files, for an example. Goals scored by 
players will get added later.    


> 3 - I don't know where can I find all the possible available URLs for the

   Sorry, the docu page for the web service is currently down [1], it 
resides @ footballdb.herokuapp.com/api   but the service is working. 
Example:

  - Get the teams for the World Cup 2014 -> 
footballdb.herokuapp.com/api/v1/event/world.2014/teams
  - Get all rounds -> 
footballdb.herokuapp.com/api/v1/event/world.2014/rounds
  - Get 1st round games -> 
footballdb.herokuapp.com/api/v1/event/world.2014/round/1
  - etc.
   
  Cheers.
