Hello Thor,

> When trying to use it with Rails 4 I've encountered number of issues 
regarding multiline anchors in regular expressions in sportdb and some
> of the dependencies (worlddb and tagutils). Is there a plan to upgrade 
these libraries to support rails 4 in the near future? 

  I've updated all gems to use /A/z anchors (instead of ^$) for model 
validations, that is, the new versions are:
 
 - worlddb v2.0.4
 - sportdb v1.8.13
 - tagutils v0.2.2

   If you still get an exception for model format regexes after the update, 
it's now considered a bug and please report it. Thanks. Cheers.
