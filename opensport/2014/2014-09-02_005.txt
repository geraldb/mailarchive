Hello,

   Thinking about it a little more. Sorry you're right  (and I'm
mistaken) currently there's no way to match players with the same name
for football clubs - it's unresolved, that is, the details need to get
worked out.

   Setting up the mapping table for a football club looks also more
more difficult than a national team because players can be from any
nation / country (players are for now organized by country [1]), thus,
leading to more possible duplicate names.   Sorry I have no quick
answer or solution. Again it's still open and details need to get
worked out.  Keep it up.

  Cheers.
