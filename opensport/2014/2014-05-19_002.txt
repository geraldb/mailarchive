   Good points and good idea. Yes. the match number, group etc is. missing=
=20
and will get added..=20

    Also something for matches for not-yet-defined-teams needs to get added=
=20
(brackets). Not sure yet what's a good way (e.g. use a brackets table or=20
just add some new calc field to matches etc.)   Any ideas welcome. Cheers.=
