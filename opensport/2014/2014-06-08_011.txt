For example, looking at 
"https://github.com/openfootball/world-cup/blob/master/2014--brazil/squads/ar-argentina.txt"

What kind of format are you using here? Is this just a custom whitespace 
delimited format?

I ask because I am looking to write the data I have 
(https://github.com/jokecamp/FootballData) in bulk into and out of your 
text formats but I have not found very strict guidelines on the exact 
format for the various items.

Any plans to allow the sports db to import other formats like json or csv?
