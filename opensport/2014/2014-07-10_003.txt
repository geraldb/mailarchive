Hello Gerald,

I was thinking about how I might use some of this data and I got to 
thinking about individual player statistics.  Is there any way to encode 
this information in sport.db?  I thought a couple tables might help:

statistics
- id
- name

stats_people
- stats_id
- stats_value
- person_id
- team_id (optional)
- event_id (optional)

The idea would be add types of stats to the statistics table (goals, shots, 
yellow cards, etc), and link them to a person - either on a team in a 
season, or across all time.  What do you think?

Best,
Carl
